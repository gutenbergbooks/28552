<h2>The Trap</h2>
<p><font size="+4">"T</font><font size="+2">HERE'S</font> a woodchuck over on the side hill
that is eating my clover," said Twinkle's father, who was a farmer.
</p><p>
"Why don't you set a trap for it?" asked Twinkle's mother.
</p><p>
"I believe I will," answered the man.
</p><p>
So, when the midday dinner was over, the farmer went to the barn and got a steel trap, and carried
it over to the clover-field on the hillside.
</p><p>
Twinkle wanted very much to go with him, but she had to help mamma wash the dishes and put
them away, and then brush up the dining-room and put it in order. But when the work was done,
and she had all the rest of the afternoon to herself, she decided to go over to the woodchuck's hole
and see how papa had set the trap, and also discover if the woodchuck had yet been caught.</p>
<p>So the little girl took her blue-and-white sun-bonnet, and climbed over the garden fence and ran
across the corn-field and through the rye until she came to the red-clover patch on the hill.</p>
<p>She knew perfectly well where the woodchuck's hole was, for she had looked at it curiously
many times; so she approached it carefully and found the trap set just in front of the hole. If the
woodchuck stepped on it, when he came out, it would grab his leg and hold him fast; and there was
a chain fastened to the trap, and also to a stout post driven into the ground, so that when the
woodchuck was caught he couldn't run away with the trap.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/13.jpg" alt="Twinkle waits for the
woodchuck"><br>TWINKLE WAITS FOR THE WOODCHUCK</p>
<p>But although the day was bright and sunshiny, and just the kind of day woodchucks like, the
clover-eater had not yet walked out of his hole to get caught in the trap.</p>
<p>So Twinkle lay down in the clover-field, half hidden by a small bank in front of the
woodchuck's hole, and began to watch for the little animal to come out. Her eyes could see right
into the hole, which seemed to slant upward into the hill instead of downward; but of course she
couldn't see very far in, because the hole wasn't straight, and grew black a little way from the
opening.</p>
<p>It was somewhat wearisome, waiting and watching so long, and the warm sun and the soft chirp
of the crickets that hopped through the clover made Twinkle drowsy. She didn't intend to go to
sleep, because then she might miss the woodchuck; but there was no harm in closing her eyes just
one little minute; so she allowed the long lashes to droop over her pretty pink cheeks&mdash;just
because they felt so heavy, and there was no way to prop them up.</p>
<p>Then, with a start, she opened her eyes again, and saw the trap and the woodchuck hole just as
they were before. Not quite, though, come to look carefully. The hole seemed to be bigger than at
first; yes, strange as it might seem, the hole was growing bigger every minute! She watched it with
much surprise, and then looked at the trap, which remained the same size it had always been. And
when she turned her eyes upon the hole once more it had not only become very big and high, but a
stone arch appeared over it, and a fine, polished front door now shut it off from the outside world.
She could even read a name upon the silver door-plate, and the name was this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/16.jpg" alt="Mr. Woodchuck"></p>

WOODCHUCK RECEIVES A TELEGRAM</p>

<br><br><br>

<hr width="10%">
<h2>Mister Woodchuck Captures a Girl</h2>
<p><font size="+4">"W</font><font size="+2">ELL,</font> I declare!" whispered Twinkle to
herself; "how could all that have happened?"</p>
<p>On each side of the door was a little green bench, big enough for two to sit upon, and between
the benches was a doorstep of white marble, with a mat lying on it. On one side Twinkle saw an
electric door-bell.</p>
<p>While she gazed at this astonishing sight a sound of rapid footsteps was heard, and a large Jack-
Rabbit, almost as big as herself, and dressed in a messenger-boy's uniform, ran up to the
woodchuck's front door and rang the bell.</p>
<p>Almost at once the door opened inward, and a curious personage stepped out.</p>
<p>Twinkle saw at a glance that it was the woodchuck himself,&mdash;but what a big and queer
woodchuck it was!</p>
<p>He wore a swallow-tailed coat, with a waistcoat of white satin and fancy knee-breeches, and
upon his feet were shoes with silver buckles. On his head was perched a tall silk hat that made him
look just as high as Twinkle's father, and in one paw he held a gold-headed cane. Also he wore big
spectacles over his eyes, which made him look more dignified than any other woodchuck Twinkle
had ever seen.</p>
<p>When this person opened the door and saw the Jack-Rabbit messenger-boy, he cried out:</p>
<p>"Well, what do you mean by ringing my bell so violently? I suppose you're half an hour late,
and trying to make me think you're in a hurry."</p>
<p>The Jack-Rabbit took a telegram from its pocket and handed it to the woodchuck without a
word in reply. At once the woodchuck tore open the envelope and read the telegram carefully.</p>
<p>"Thank you. There's no answer," he said; and in an instant the Jack-Rabbit had whisked away
and was gone.</p>
<p>"Well, well," said the woodchuck, as if to himself, "the foolish farmer has set a trap for me, it
seems, and my friends have sent a telegram to warn me. Let's see&mdash;where is the thing?"</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/21.jpg" alt="Mr. Woodchuck discovers Twinkle"><br>MR.
WOODCHUCK DISCOVERS TWINKLE</p>
<p>He soon discovered the trap, and seizing hold of the chain he pulled the peg out of the ground
and threw the whole thing far away into the field.</p>
<p>"I must give that farmer a sound scolding," he muttered, "for he's becoming so impudent lately
that soon he will think he owns the whole country."</p>
<p>But now his eyes fell upon Twinkle, who lay in the clover staring up at him; and the
woodchuck gave a laugh and grabbed her fast by one arm.</p>
<p>"Oh ho!" he exclaimed; "you're spying upon me, are you?"</p>
<p>"I'm just waiting to see you get caught in the trap," said the girl, standing up because the big
creature pulled upon her arm. She wasn't much frightened, strange to say, because this woodchuck
had a good-humored way about him that gave her confidence.</p>
<p>"You would have to wait a long time for that," he said, with a laugh that was a sort of low
chuckle. "Instead of seeing me caught, you've got caught yourself. That's turning the tables, sure
enough; isn't it?"</p>
<p>"I suppose it is," said Twinkle, regretfully. "Am I a prisoner?"</p>
<p>"You might call it that; and then, again, you mightn't," answered the woodchuck. "To tell you
the truth, I hardly know what to do with you. But come inside, and we'll talk it over. We musn't be
seen out here in the fields."</p>
<p>Still holding fast to her arm, the woodchuck led her through the door, which he carefully closed
and locked. Then they passed through a kind of hallway, into which opened several handsomely
furnished rooms, and out again into a beautiful garden at the back, all filled with flowers and
brightly colored plants, and with a pretty fountain playing in the middle. A high stone wall was built
around the garden, shutting it off from all the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The woodchuck led his prisoner to a bench beside the fountain, and told her to sit down and
make herself comfortable.</p>

<h2>Mister Woodchuck Scolds Tinkle</h2>
<p><font size="+4">T</font><font size="+2">WINKLE</font> was much pleased with her
surroundings, and soon discovered several gold-fishes swimming in the water at the foot of the
mountain.</p>
<p>"Well, how does it strike you?" asked the woodchuck, strutting up and down the gravel walk
before her and swinging his gold-headed cane rather gracefully.</p>
<p>"It seems like a dream," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>"To be sure," he answered, nodding. "You'd no business to fall asleep in the clover."</p>
<p>"Did I?" she asked, rather startled at the suggestion.</p>
<p>"It stands to reason you did," he replied. "You don't for a moment think this is real, do
you?"</p>
<p>"It <i>seems</i> real," she answered. "Aren't you the woodchuck?"</p>
<p>"<i>Mister</i> Woodchuck, if you please. Address me properly, young lady, or you'll make me
angry."</p>
<p>"Well, then, aren't you Mister Woodchuck?"</p>
<p>"At present I am; but when you wake up, I won't be," he said.</p>
<p>"Then you think I'm dreaming?"</p>
<p>"You must figure that out for yourself," said Mister Woodchuck.</p>
<p>"What do you suppose made me dream?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"Do you think it's something I've eaten?" she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"I hardly think so. This isn't any nightmare, you know, because there's nothing at all horrible
about it so far. You've probably been reading some of those creepy, sensational story-books."</p>
<p>"I haven't read a book in a long time," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Dreams," remarked Mister Woodchuck, thoughtfully, "are not always to be accounted for. But
this conversation is all wrong. When one is dreaming one doesn't talk about it, or even know it's a
dream. So let's speak of something else."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/29.jpg" alt="Do you think it's something I've eaten?"><br>"DO
YOU THINK IT'S SOMETHING I'VE EATEN?"</p>
<p>"It's very pleasant in this garden," said Twinkle. "I don't mind being here a bit."</p>
<p>"But you can't stay here," replied Mister Woodchuck, "and you ought to be very uncomfortable
in my presence. You see, you're one of the deadliest enemies of my race. All you human beings
live for or think of is how to torture and destroy woodchucks."</p>
<p>"Oh, no!" she answered. "We have many more important things than that to think of. But when
a woodchuck gets eating our clover and the vegetables, and spoils a lot, we just have to do
something to stop it. That's why my papa set the trap."</p>
<p>"You're selfish," said Mister Woodchuck, "and you're cruel to poor little animals that can't help
themselves, and have to eat what they can find, or starve. There's enough for all of us growing in
the broad fields."</p>
<p>Twinkle felt a little ashamed.</p>
<p>"We have to sell the clover and the vegetables to earn our living," she explained; "and if the
animals eat them up we can't sell them."</p>
<p>"We don't eat enough to rob you," said the woodchuck, "and the land belonged to the wild
creatures long before you people came here and began to farm. And really, there is no reason why
you should be so cruel. It hurts dreadfully to be caught in a trap, and an animal captured in that
way sometimes has to suffer for many hours before the man comes to kill it. We don't mind the
killing so much. Death doesn't last but an instant. But every minute of suffering seems to be an
hour."</p>
<p>"That's true," said Twinkle, feeling sorry and repentant. "I'll ask papa never to set another
trap."</p>
<p>"That will be some help," returned Mister Woodchuck, more cheerfully, "and I hope you'll not
forget the promise when you wake up. But that isn't enough to settle the account for all our past
sufferings, I assure you; so I am trying to think of a suitable way to punish you for the past
wickedness of your father, and of all other men that have set traps."</p>
<p>"Why, if you feel that way," said the little girl, "you're just as bad as we are!"</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/33.jpg" alt="Mrs. Woodchuck and her family"><br>MRS.
WOODCHUCK AND HER FAMILY</p>
<p>"How's that?" asked Mister Woodchuck, pausing in his walk to look at her.</p>
<p>"It's as naughty to want revenge as it is to be selfish and cruel," she said.</p>
<p>"I believe you are right about that," answered the animal, taking off his silk hat and rubbing the
fur smooth with his elbow. "But woodchucks are not perfect, any more than men are, so you'll
have to take us as you find us. And now I'll call my family, and exhibit you to them. The children,
especially, will enjoy seeing the wild human girl I've had the luck to capture."</p>
<p>"Wild!" she cried, indignantly.</p>
<p>"If you're not wild now, you will be before you wake up," he said.</p>

<br><br><br>
<h1><a name="1-4">Chapter IV</a></h1>
<hr width="10%">
<h2>Mrs. Woodchuck and Her Family</h2>
<p><font size="+4">B</font><font size="+2">UT</font>UT Mister Woodchuck had no need to call
his family, for just as he spoke a chatter of voices was heard and Mrs. Woodchuck came walking
down a path of the garden with several young woodchucks following after her.</p>
<p>The lady animal was very fussily dressed, with puffs and ruffles and laces all over her silk
gown, and perched upon her head was a broad white hat with long ostrich plumes. She was
exceedingly fat, even for a woodchuck, and her head fitted close to her body, without any neck
whatever to separate them. Although it was shady in the garden, she held a lace parasol over her
head, and her walk was so mincing and airy that Twinkle almost laughed in her face.</p>
<p>The young woodchucks were of several sizes and kinds. One little woodchuck girl rolled before
her a doll's baby-cab, in which lay a woodchuck doll made of cloth, in quite a perfect imitation of a
real woodchuck. It was stuffed with something soft to make it round and fat, and its eyes were two
glass beads sewn upon the face. A big boy woodchuck wore knickerbockers and a Tam o' Shanter
cap and rolled a hoop; and there were several smaller boy and girl woodchucks, dressed quite as
absurdly, who followed after their mother in a long train.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/37.jpg" alt="Twinkle and the young
woodchucks"><br>TWINKLE AND THE YOUNG WOODCHUCKS</p>
<p>"My dear," said Mister Woodchuck to his wife, "here is a human creature that I captured just
outside our front door."</p>
<p>"Huh!" sneered the lady woodchuck, looking at Twinkle in a very haughty way; "why will you
bring such an animal into our garden, Leander? It makes me shiver just to look at the horrid
thing!"</p>
<p>"Oh, mommer!" yelled one of the children, "see how skinny the beast is!"</p>
<p>"Hasn't any hair on its face at all," said another, "or on its paws!"</p>
<p>"And no sign of a tail!" cried the little woodchuck girl with the doll.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's a very strange and remarkable creature," said the mother. "Don't touch it, my precious
darlings. It might bite."</p>
<p>"You needn't worry," said Twinkle, rather provoked at these speeches. "I wouldn't bite a dirty,
greasy woodchuck on any account!"</p>
<p>"Whoo! did you hear what she called us, mommer? She says we're greasy and dirty!" shouted
the children, and some of them grabbed pebbles from the path in their paws, as if to throw them at
Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Tut, tut! don't be cruel," said Mister Woodchuck. "Remember the poor creature is a prisoner,
and isn't used to good society; and besides that, she's dreaming."</p>
<p>"Really?" exclaimed Mrs. Woodchuck, looking at the girl curiously.</p>
<p>"To be sure," he answered. "Otherwise she wouldn't see us dressed in such fancy clothes, nor
would we be bigger than she is. The whole thing is unnatural, my dear, as you must admit."</p>
<p>"But <i>we</i>'re not dreaming; are we, Daddy?" anxiously asked the boy with the hoop.</p>
<p>"Certainly not," Mister Woodchuck answered; "so this is a fine opportunity for you to study one
of those human animals who have always been our worst enemies. You will notice they are very
curiously made. Aside from their lack of hair in any place except the top of the head, their paws
are formed in a strange manner. Those long slits in them make what are called fingers, and their
claws are flat and dull&mdash;not at all sharp and strong like ours."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/41.jpg" alt="&quot;You're a disagreeable
creature!&quot;"><br>"YOU'RE A DISAGREEABLE CREATURE!"</p>
<p>"I think the beast is ugly," said Mrs. Woodchuck. "It would give me the shivers to touch its
skinny flesh."</p>
<p>"I'm glad of that," said Twinkle, indignantly. "You wouldn't have <i>all</i> the shivers, I can
tell you! And you're a disagreeable, ign'rant creature! If you had any manners at all, you'd treat
strangers more politely."</p>
<p>"Just listen to the thing!" said Mrs. Woodchuck, in a horrified tone. "Isn't it wild, though!"</p>

<h2>Mr. Woodchuck Argues the Question</h2>
<p><font size="+4">"R</font><font size="+2">EALLY,"</font> Mister Woodchuck said to his wife,
"you should be more considerate of the little human's feelings. She is quite intelligent and tame, for
one of her kind, and has a tender heart, I am sure."</p>
<p>"I don't see anything intelligent about her," said the girl woodchuck.</p>
<p>"I guess I've been to school as much as you have," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>"School! Why, what's that?"</p>
<p>"Don't you know what school is?" cried Twinkle, much amused.</p>
<p>"We don't have school here," said Mister Woodchuck, as if proud of the fact.</p>
<p>"Don't you know any geography?" asked the child.</p>
<p>"We haven't any use for it," said Mister Woodchuck; "for we never get far from home, and
don't care a rap what state bounds Florida on the south. We don't travel much, and studying
geography would be time wasted."</p>
<p>"But don't you study arithmetic?" she asked; "don't you know how to do sums?"</p>
<p>"Why should we?" he returned. "The thing that bothers you humans most, and that's money, is
not used by us woodchucks. So we don't need to figure and do sums."</p>
<p>"I don't see how you get along without money," said Twinkle, wonderingly. "You must have to
buy all your fine clothes."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/45.jpg" alt="&quot;You'd make a mighty poor
woodchuck&quot;"><br>"YOU'D MAKE A MIGHTY POOR WOODCHUCK"</p>
<p>"You know very well that woodchucks don't wear clothes, under ordinary circumstances,"
Mister Woodchuck replied. "It's only because you are dreaming that you see us dressed in this
way."</p>
<p>"Perhaps that's true," said Twinkle. "But don't talk to me about not being intelligent, or not
knowing things. If you haven't any schools it's certain I know more than your whole family put
together!"</p>
<p>"About some things, perhaps," acknowledged Mister Woodchuck. "But tell me: do you know
which kind of red clover is the best to eat?"</p>
<p>"No," she said.</p>
<p>"Or how to dig a hole in the ground to live in, with different rooms and passages, so that it
slants up hill and the rain won't come in and drown you?"</p>
<p>"No," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>"And could you tell, on the second day of February (which is woodchuck day, you know),
whether it's going to be warm weather, or cold, during the next six weeks?"</p>
<p>"I don't believe I could," replied the girl.</p>
<p>"Then," said Mister Woodchuck, "there are some things that we know that you don't; and
although a woodchuck might not be of much account in one of your schoolrooms, you must
forgive me for saying that I think you 'd make a mighty poor woodchuck."</p>
<p>"I think so, too!" said Twinkle, laughing.</p>
<p>"And now, little human," he resumed, after looking at his watch, "it's nearly time for you to
wake up; so if we intend to punish you for all the misery your people has inflicted on the
woodchucks, we won't have a minute to spare."</p>
<p>"Don't be in a hurry," said Twinkle. "I can wait."</p>
<p>"She's trying to get out of it," exclaimed Mrs. Woodchuck, scornfully. "Don't you let her,
Leander."</p>
<p>"Certainly not, my dear," he replied; "but I haven't decided how to punish her."</p>
<p>"Take her to Judge Stoneyheart," said Mrs. Woodchuck. "He will know what to do with
her."</p>

with joy, crying: "Take her, Daddy! Take her to old Stoneyheart! Oh, my! won't he give it to her,
though!"</p>
<p>"Who is Judge Stoneyheart?" asked Twinkle, a little uneasily.</p>
<p>"A highly respected and aged woodchuck who is cousin to my wife's grandfather," was the
reply. "We consider him the wisest and most intelligent of our race; but, while he is very just in all
things, the judge never shows any mercy to evil-doers."</p>
<p>"I haven't done anything wrong," said the girl.</p>
<p>"But your father has, and much wrong is done us by the other farmers around here. They fight
my people without mercy, and kill every woodchuck they can possibly catch."</p>
<p>Twinkle was silent, for she knew this to be true.</p>
<p>"For my part," continued Mister Woodchuck, "I'm very soft-hearted, and wouldn't even step on
an ant if I could help it. Also I am sure you have a kind disposition. But you are a human, and I am
a woodchuck; so I think I will take you to old Stoneyheart and let him decide your fate."</p>
<p>"Hooray!" yelled the young woodchucks, and away they ran through the paths of the garden,
followed slowly by their fat mother, who held the lace parasol over her head as if she feared she
would be sunstruck.</p>
<p>Twinkle was glad to see them go. She didn't care much for the woodchuck children, they were
so wild and ill-mannered, and their mother was even more disagreeable than they were. As for
Mister Woodchuck, she did not object to him so much; in fact, she rather liked to talk to him, for
his words were polite and his eyes pleasant and kindly.</p>
<p>"Now, my dear," he said, "as we are about to leave this garden, where you have been quite
secure, I must try to prevent your running away when we are outside the wall. I hope it won't hurt
your feelings to become a real prisoner for a few minutes."</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/53.jpg" alt="Arriving at Judge Stoneyheart's"><br>ARRIVING
AT JUDGE STONEYHEART'S</p>
<p>Then Mister Woodchuck drew from his pocket a leather collar, very much like a dog-collar,
Twinkle thought, and proceeded to buckle it around the girl's neck. To the collar was attached a
fine chain about six feet long, and the other end of the chain Mister Woodchuck held in his
hand.</p>
<p>"Now, then," said he, "please come along quietly, and don't make a fuss."</p>
<p>He led her to the end of the garden and opened a wooden gate in the wall, through which they
passed. Outside the garden the ground was nothing but hard, baked earth, without any grass or other
green thing growing upon it, or any tree or shrub to shade it from the hot sun. And not far away
stood a round mound, also of baked earth, which Twinkle at once decided to be a house, because it
had a door and some windows in it.</p>
<p>There was no living thing in sight&mdash;not even a woodchuck&mdash;and Twinkle didn't
care much for the baked-clay scenery.</p>
<p>Mister Woodchuck, holding fast to the chain, led his prisoner across the barren space to the
round mound, where he paused to rap softly upon the door.</p>

<h2>Twinkle is Condemned</h2>
<p><font size="+4">"C</font><font size="+2">OME</font> in!" called a voice.</p>
<p>Mister Woodchuck pushed open the door and entered, drawing Tinkle after him by the
chain.</p>
<p>In the middle of the room sat a woodchuck whose hair was grizzled with old age. He wore big
spectacles upon his nose, and a round knitted cap, with a tassel dangling from the top, upon his
head. His only garment was an old and faded dressing-gown.</p>
<p>When they entered, the old woodchuck was busy playing a game with a number of baked-clay
dominoes, which he shuffled and arranged upon a baked-mud table; nor did he look up for a long
time, but continued to match the dominoes and to study their arrangement with intense interest.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/57.jpg" alt="Judge Stoneyheart at home"><br>JUDGE
STONEYHEART AT HOME</p>
<p>Finally, however, he finished the game, and then he raised his head and looked sharply at his
visitors.</p>
<p>"Good afternoon, Judge," said Mister Woodchuck, taking off his silk hat and bowing
respectfully.</p>
<p>The judge did not answer him, but continued to stare at Twinkle.</p>
<p>"I have called to ask your advice," continued Mister Woodchuck. "By good chance I have been
able to capture one of those fierce humans that are the greatest enemies of peaceful
woodchucks."</p>
<p>The judge nodded his gray head wisely, but still answered nothing.</p>
<p>"But now that I've captured the creature, I don't know what to do with her," went on Mister
Woodchuck; "although I believe, of course, she should be punished in some way, and made to feel
as unhappy as her people have made us feel. Yet I realize that it's a dreadful thing to hurt any living
creature, and as far as I'm concerned I'm quite willing to forgive her." With these words he wiped
his face with a red silk handkerchief, as if really distressed.</p>
<p>"She's dreaming," said the judge, in a sharp, quick voice.</p>
<p>"Am I?" asked Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Of course. You were probably lying on the wrong side when you went to sleep."</p>
<p>"Oh!" she said. "I wondered what made it."</p>
<p>"Very disagreeable dream, isn't it?" continued the judge.</p>
<p>"Not so very," she answered. "It's interesting to see and hear woodchucks in their own homes,
and Mister Woodchuck has shown me how cruel it is for us to set traps for you."</p>
<p>"Good!" said the judge. "But some dreams are easily forgotten, so I'll teach you a lesson you'll
be likely to remember. You shall be caught in a trap yourself."</p>
<p>"Me!" cried Twinkle, in dismay.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/61.jpg" alt="The judge fetches a trap"><br>THE JUDGE
FETCHES A TRAP</p>
<p>"Yes, you. When you find how dreadfully it hurts you'll bear the traps in mind forever
afterward. People don't remember dreams unless the dreams are unusually horrible. But I guess
you'll remember this one."</p>
<p>He got up and opened a mud cupboard, from which he took a big steel trap. Twinkle could see
that it was just like the trap papa had set to catch the woodchucks, only it seemed much bigger and
stronger.</p>
<p>The judge got a mallet and with it pounded a stake into the mud floor. Then he fastened the
chain of the trap to the stake, and afterward opened the iron jaws of the cruel-looking thing and set
them with a lever, so that the slightest touch would spring the trap and make the strong jaws snap
together.</p>
<p>"Now, little girl," said he, "you must step in the trap and get caught."</p>
<p>"Why, it would break my leg!" cried Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Did your father care whether a woodchuck got its leg broken or not?" asked the judge.</p>
<p>"No," she answered, beginning to be greatly frightened.</p>
<p>"Step!" cried the judge, sternly.</p>
<p>"It will hurt awfully," said Mister Woodchuck; "but that can't be helped. Traps are cruel things,
at the best."</p>
<p>Twinkle was now trembling with nervousness and fear.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/64.jpg" alt="&quot;Step!&quot; cried the judge,
sternly"><br>"STEP!" CRIED THE JUDGE, STERNLY</p>
<p>"Step!" called the judge, again.</p>
<p>"Dear me!" said Mister Woodchuck, just then, as he looked earnestly into Twinkle's face, "I
believe she's going to wake up!"</p>
<p>"That's too bad," said the judge.</p>
<p>"No, I'm glad of it," replied Mister Woodchuck.</p>
<p>And just then the girl gave a start and opened her eyes.</p>
<p>She was lying in the clover, and before her was the opening of the woodchuck's hole, with the
trap still set before it.</p>

<h2>Twinkle Remembers</h2>
<p><font size="+4">"P</font><font size="+2">APA,"</font> said Twinkle, when supper was over
and she was nestled snugly in his lap, "I wish you wouldn't set any more traps for the
woodchucks."</p>
<p>"Why not, my darling?" he asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"They're cruel," she answered. "It must hurt the poor animals dreadfully to be caught in
them."</p>
<p>"I suppose it does," said her father, thoughtfully. "But if I don't trap the woodchucks they eat
our clover and vegetables."</p>
<p>"Never mind that," said Twinkle, earnestly. "Let's divide with them. God made the woodchucks,
you know, just as He made us, and they can't plant and grow things as we do; so they have to take
what they can get, or starve to death. And surely, papa, there's enough to eat in this big and
beautiful world, for all of God's creatures."</p>
<p>Papa whistled softly, although his face was grave; and then he bent down and kissed his little
girl's forehead.</p>
<p>"I won't set any more traps, dear," he said.</p>
<p>And that evening, after Twinkle had been tucked snugly away in bed, her father walked slowly
through the sweet-smelling fields to the woodchuck's hole; there lay the trap, showing plainly in the
bright moonlight. He picked it up and carried it back to the barn. It was never used again.</p>

<h2>Jim Crow Becomes a Pet</h2>
<p><font size="+4">O</font><font size="+2">NE</font> day, when Twinkle's father was in the
corn-field, he shot his gun at a flock of crows that were busy digging up, with their long bills, the
kernels of corn he had planted. But Twinkle's father didn't aim very straight, for the birds screamed
at the bang of the gun and quickly flew away&mdash;all except one young crow that fluttered its
wings, but couldn't rise into the air, and so began to run along the ground in an effort to escape.</p>
<p>The man chased the young crow, and caught it; and then he found that one of the little lead
bullets had broken the right wing, although the bird seemed not to be hurt in any other way.</p>
<p>It struggled hard, and tried to peck the hands that held it; but it was too young to hurt any one,
so Twinkle's father decided he would carry it home to his little girl.</p>
<p>"Here's a pet for you, Twinkle," he said, as he came into the house. "It can't fly, because its
wing is broken; but don't let it get too near your eyes, or it may peck at them. It's very wild and
fierce, you know."</p>
<p>Twinkle was delighted with her pet, and at once got her mother to bandage the broken wing, so
that it would heal quickly.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/75.jpg" alt="Twinkle and Jim Crow"><br>TWINKLE AND
JIM CROW</p>
<p>The crow had jet black feathers, but there was a pretty purplish and violet gloss, or sheen, on its
back and wings, and its eyes were bright and had a knowing look in them. They were hazel-brown
in color, and the bird had a queer way of turning his head on one side to look at Twinkle with his
right eye, and then twisting it the other side that he might see her with his left eye. She often
wondered if she looked the same to both eyes, or if each one made her seem different.</p>
<p>She named her pet "Jim Crow" because papa said that all crows were called Jim, although he
never could find out the reason. But the name seemed to fit her pet as well as any, so Twinkle
never bothered about the reason.</p>
<p>Having no cage to keep him in, and fearing he would run away, the girl tied a strong cord
around one of Jim Crow's legs, and the other end of the cord she fastened to the round of a
chair&mdash;or to the table-leg&mdash;when they were in the house. The crow would run all
around, as far as the string would let him go; but he couldn't get away. And when they went out of
doors Twinkle held the end of the cord in her hand, as one leads a dog, and Jim Crow would run
along in front of her, and then stop and wait. And when she came near he'd run on again,
screaming "Caw! Caw!" at the top of his shrill little voice.</p>
<p>He soon came to know he belonged to Twinkle, and would often lie in her lap or perch upon
her shoulder. And whenever she entered the room where he was he would say, "Caw&mdash;caw!"
to her, in pleading tones, until she picked him up or took some notice of him.</p>
<p>It was wonderful how quickly a bird that had always lived wild and free seemed to become
tame and gentle. Twinkle's father said that was because he was so young, and because his broken
wing kept him from flying in the air and rejoining his fellows. But Jim Crow wasn't as tame as he
seemed, and he had a very wicked and ungrateful disposition, as you will presently learn.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/79.jpg" alt="Jim gets into mischief"><br>JIM GETS INTO
MISCHIEF</p>
<p>For a few weeks, however, he was as nice a pet as any little girl could wish for. He got into
mischief occasionally, and caused mamma some annoyance when he waded into a pan of milk or
jumped upon the dinner table and ate up papa's pumpkin pie before Twinkle could stop him. But
all pets are more or less trouble, at times, so Jim Crow escaped with a few severe scoldings from
mamma, which never seemed to worry him in the least or make him a bit unhappy.

<hr width="10%">
<h2>Jim Crow Runs Away</h2>
<p><font size="+4">A</font><font size="+2">T</font> last Jim got so tame that Twinkle took the
cord off his leg and let him go free, wherever he pleased. So he wandered all over the house and
out into the yard, where he chased the ducks and bothered the pigs and made himself generally
disliked. He had a way of perching upon the back of old Tom, papa's favorite horse, and chattering
away in Tom's ear until the horse plunged and pranced in his stall to get rid of his unwelcome
visitor.</p>
<p>Twinkle always kept the bandage on the wounded wing, for she didn't know whether it was
well yet, or not, and she thought it was better to be on the safe side. But the truth was, that Jim
Crow's wing had healed long ago, and was now as strong as ever; and, as the weeks passed by, and
he grew big and fat, a great longing came into his wild heart to fly again&mdash;far, far up into the
air and away to the lands where there were forests of trees and brooks of running water.</p>
<p>He didn't ever expect to rejoin his family again. They were far enough away by this time. And
he didn't care much to associate with other crows. All he wanted was to be free, and do exactly as
he pleased, and not have some one cuffing him a dozen times a day because he was doing
wrong.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/83.jpg" alt="Jim gets rid of his bandage"><br>JIM GETS RID
OF HIS BANDAGE</p>
<p>So one morning, before Twinkle was up, or even awake, Jim Crow pecked at the bandage on
his wing until he got the end unfastened, and then it wasn't long before the entire strip of cloth was
loosened and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Now Jim fluttered his feathers, and pruned them with his long bill where they had been pressed
together, and presently he knew that the wing which had been injured was exactly as strong and
well as the other one. He could fly away whenever he pleased.</p>
<p>The crow had been well fed by Twinkle and her mamma, and was in splendid health. But he
was not at all grateful. With the knowledge of his freedom a fierce, cruel joy crept into his heart,
and he resumed the wild nature that crows are born with and never lay aside as long as they
live.</p>
<p>Having forgotten in an instant that he had ever been tame, and the pet of a gentle little girl, Jim
Crow had no thought of saying good-bye to Twinkle. Instead, he decided he would do something
that would make these foolish humans remember him for a long time. So he dashed into a group of
young chickens that had only been hatched a day or two before, and killed seven of them with his
strong, curved claws and his wicked black beak. When the mother hen flew at him he pecked at her
eyes; and then, screaming a defiance to all the world, Jim Crow flew into the air and sailed away to
a new life in another part of the world.</p>

<h2>Jim Crow Finds a New Home</h2>
<p><font size="+4">I</font><font size="+2">'LL</font> not try to tell you of all the awful things
this bad crow did during the next few days, on his long journey toward the South.</p>
<p>Twinkle almost cried when she found her pet gone; and she really did cry when she saw the
poor murdered chickens. But mamma said she was very glad to have Jim Crow run away, and papa
scowled angrily and declared he was sorry he had not killed the cruel bird when he shot at it in the
corn-field.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/87.jpg" alt="Twinkle mourns for her
chickens"><br>TWINKLE MOURNS FOR HER CHICKENS</p>
<p>In the mean time the runaway crow flew through the country, and when he was hungry he
would stop at a farm-house and rob a hen's nest and eat the eggs. It was his knowledge of farm-
houses that made him so bold; but the farmers shot at the thieving bird once or twice, and this
frightened Jim Crow so badly that he decided to keep away from the farms and find a living in
some less dangerous way.</p>
<p>And one day he came to a fine forest, where there were big and little trees of all kinds, with
several streams of water running through the woods.</p>
<p>"Here," said Jim Crow, "I will make my home; for surely this is the finest place I am ever likely
to find."</p>
<p>There were plenty of birds in this forest, for Jim could hear them singing and twittering
everywhere among the trees; and their nests hung suspended from branches, or nestled in a fork
made by two limbs, in almost every direction he might look. And the birds were of many kinds,
too: robins, thrushes, bullfinches, mocking-birds, wrens, yellowtails and skylarks. Even tiny
humming-birds fluttered around the wild flowers that grew in the glades; and in the waters of the
brooks waded long-legged herons, while kingfishers sat upon overhanging branches and waited
patiently to seize any careless fish that might swim too near them. Jim Crow decided this must be a
real paradise for birds, because it was far away from the houses of men. So he made up his mind to
get acquainted with the inhabitants of the forest as soon as possible, and let them know who he
was, and that he must be treated with proper respect.</p>
<p>In a big fir-tree, whose branches reached nearly to the ground, he saw a large gathering of the
birds, who sat chattering and gossiping pleasantly together. So he flew down and joined them.</p>
<p>"Good morning, folks," he said; and his voice sounded to them like a harsh croak, because it
had become much deeper in tone since he had grown to his full size.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/91.jpg" alt="&quot;Good morning, folks&quot;"><br>"GOOD
MORNING, FOLKS"</p>
<p>The birds looked at him curiously, and one or two fluttered their wings in a timid and nervous
way; but none of them, little or big, thought best to make any reply.</p>
<p>"Well," said Jim Crow, gruffly, "what's the matter with you fellows? Haven't you got tongues?
You seemed to talk fast enough a minute ago."</p>
<p>"Excuse me," replied a bullfinch, in a dignified voice; "we haven't the honor of your
acquaintance. You are a stranger."</p>
<p>"My name's Jim Crow," he answered, "and I won't be a stranger long, because I'm going to live
here."</p>
<p>They all looked grave at this speech, and a little thrush hopped from one branch to another, and
remarked:</p>
<p>"We haven't any crows here at all. If you want to find your own folks you must go to some
other place."</p>
<p>"What do I care about my own folks?" asked Jim, with a laugh that made the little thrush
shudder. "I prefer to live alone."</p>
<p>"Haven't you a mate?" asked a robin, speaking in a very polite tone.</p>
<p>"No; and I don't want any," said Jim Crow. "I'm going to live all by myself. There's plenty of
room in this forest, I guess."</p>
<p>"Certainly," replied the bullfinch. "There is plenty of room for you here if you behave yourself
and obey the laws."</p>
<p>"Who's going to make me?" he asked, angrily.</p>
<p>"Any decent person, even if he's a crow, is bound to respect the law," answered the bullfinch,
calmly.</p>
<p>Jim Crow was a little ashamed, for he didn't wish to acknowledge he wasn't decent. So he
said:</p>
<p>"What are your laws?"</p>
<p>"The same as those in all other forests. You must respect the nests and the property of all other
birds, and not interfere with them when they're hunting for food. And you must warn your fellow-
birds whenever there is danger, and assist them to protect their young from prowling beasts. If you
obey these laws, and do not steal from or interfere with your neighbors, you have a right to a nest
in our forest."</p>
<p>"To be quite frank with you, though," said the robin, "we prefer your room to your
company."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/95.jpg" alt="Jim finds a home"><br>JIM FINDS A HOME</p>
<p>"I'm going to stay," said the crow. "I guess I'm as good as the rest of you; so you fellows just
mind your own business and I'll mind mine."</p>
<p>With these words he left them, and when he had mounted to a position above the trees he saw
that one tall, slim pine was higher than all the rest, and that at its very top was a big deserted
nest.</p>

<hr width="10%">
<h2>Jim Crow Becomes a Robber</h2>
<p><font size="+4">I</font><font size="+2">T</font> looked like a crow's nest to Jim, so he flew
toward the pine tree and lit upon a branch close by. One glance told him that at some time it really
must have been the home of birds of his kind, who for some reason had abandoned it long ago.
The nest was large and bulky, being made of strong sticks woven together with fine roots and
grasses. It was rough outside, but smooth inside, and when Jim Crow had kicked out the dead
leaves and twigs that had fallen into it, he decided it was nearly as good as new, and plenty good
enough for a solitary crow like him to live in. So with his bill he made a mark on the nest, that
every bird might know it belonged to him, and felt that at last he had found a home.</p>
<p>During the next few days he made several attempts to get acquainted with the other birds, but
they were cold and distant, though very polite to him; and none of them seemed to care for his
society.</p>
<p>No bird ever came near his nest, but he often flew down to the lower trees and perched upon
one or another of them, so gradually the birds of the forest got used to seeing him around, and paid
very little attention to his actions.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/99.jpg" alt="Mrs. Wren is heart-broken"><br>MRS. WREN IS
HEART-BROKEN</p>
<p>One day Mrs. Wren missed two brown eggs from her nest, and her little heart was nearly broken
with grief. It took the mocking bird and the bullfinch a whole afternoon to comfort her, while Mr.
Wren hopped around in nearly as much distress as his wife. No animals had been seen in the forest
who would do this evil thing, so no one could imagine who the thief might be.</p>
<p>Such an outrage was almost unknown in this pleasant forest, and it made all the birds nervous
and fearful. A few days later a still greater horror came upon them, for the helpless young children
of Mrs. Linnet were seized one morning from their nest, while their parents were absent in search
of food, and were carried away bodily. Mr. Linnet declared that on his way back to his nest he had
seen a big black monster leaving it, but had been too frightened to notice just what the creature
looked like. But the lark, who had been up very early that morning, stated that he had seen no one
near that part of the forest except Jim Crow, who had flown swiftly to his nest in the tall pine-
tree.</p>
<p>This was enough to make all the birds look upon Jim Crow with grave suspicion, and Robin
Redbreast called a secret meeting of all the birds to discuss the question and decide what must be
done to preserve their nests from the robber. Jim Crow was so much bigger and fiercer than any of
the others that none dared accuse him openly or venture to quarrel with him; but they had a good
friend living not far away who was not afraid of Jim Crow or any one else, so they finally decided
to send for him and ask his assistance.</p>
<p>The starling undertook to be the messenger, and as soon as the meeting was over he flew away
upon his errand.</p>
<p>"What were all you folks talking about?" asked the crow, flying down and alighting upon a limb
near to those who had not yet left the place of meeting.</p>
<p>"We were talking about you," said the thrush, boldly; "and you wouldn't care at all to know
what we said, Mister Jim Crow."</p>
<p>Jim looked a trifle guilty and ashamed at hearing this, but knowing they were all afraid of him
he burst out into a rude laugh.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/103.jpg" alt="&quot;Caw! Caw! Caw! What do I
care?&quot;"><br>"CAW! CAW! CAW! WHAT DO I CARE?"</p>
<p>"Caw! caw! caw!" he chuckled hoarsely; "what do I care what you say about me? But don't you
get saucy, my pretty thrush, or your friends will miss you some fine morning, and never see you
again."</p>
<p>This awful threat made them all silent, for they remembered the fate of poor Mrs. Linnet's
children, and very few of the birds now had any doubt but that Jim Crow knew more about the
death of those helpless little ones than he cared to tell.</p>
<p>Finding they would not talk with him, the crow flew back to his tree, where he sat sullenly
perched upon a branch near his nest. And they were very glad to get rid of him so easily.</p>

<h2>Jim Crow Meets Policeman Blue Jay</h2>
<p><font size="+4">N</font><font size="+2">EXT</font> morning Jim Crow woke up hungry,
and as he sat lazily in his big nest, he remembered that he had seen four pretty brown eggs,
speckled with white, in the nest of the oriole that lived at the edge of the forest.</p>
<p>"Those eggs will taste very good for breakfast," he thought. "I'll go at once and get them; and if
old Mammy Oriole makes a fuss, I'll eat her, too."</p>
<p>He hopped out of his nest and on to a branch, and the first thing his sharp eye saw was a big
and strange bird sitting upon the tree just opposite him and looking steadily in his direction.</p>
<p>Never having lived among other birds until now, the crow did not know what kind of bird this
was, but as he faced the new-comer he had a sort of shiver in his heart that warned him to beware
an enemy. Indeed, it was none other than the Blue Jay that had appeared so suddenly, and he had
arrived that morning because the starling had told him of the thefts that had taken place, and the
Blue Jay is well known as the policeman of the forest and a terror to all evil-doers.</p>
<p>In size he was nearly as big as Jim Crow himself, and he had a large crest of feathers on the top
of his head that made him look even more fierce&mdash;especially when he ruffled them up. His
body was purplish blue color on the back and purplish gray below, and there was a collar of black
feathers running all around his neck. But his wings and tail were a beautiful rich blue, as delightful
in color as the sky on a fine May morning; so in personal appearance Policeman Blue Jay was
much handsomer than Jim Crow. But it was the sharp, stout beak that most alarmed the crow, and
had Jim been wiser he would have known that before him was the most deadly foe of his race, and
that the greatest pleasure a Blue Jay finds in life is to fight with and punish a crow.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/107.jpg" alt="Policeman Blue Jay"><br>POLICEMAN BLUE
JAY</p>
<p>But Jim was not very wise; and so he imagined, after his first terror had passed away, that he
could bully this bird as he had the others, and make it fear him.</p>
<p>"Well, what are you doing here?" he called out, in his crossest voice, for he was anxious to get
away and rob the oriole's nest.</p>
<p>The Blue Jay gave a scornful, chattering laugh as he answered:</p>
<p>"That's none of your business, Jim Crow."</p>
<p>"Take care!" warned the crow; "you'll be sorry if you don't treat me with proper respect."</p>
<p>The Blue Jay winked solemnly, in a way that would have been very comical to any observer
other than the angry crow.</p>
<p>"Don't hurt me&mdash;please don't!" he said, fluttering on the branch as if greatly frightened.
"My mother would feel dreadful bad if anything happened to me."</p>
<p>"Well, then, behave yourself," returned the crow, strutting proudly along a limb and flopping
his broad wings in an impressive manner. For he was foolish enough to think he had made the other
afraid.</p>
<p>But no sooner had he taken flight and soared into the air than the Blue Jay darted at him like an
arrow from a bow, and before Jim Crow could turn to defend himself the bill of his enemy struck
him full in the breast. Then, with a shriek of shrill laughter, the policeman darted away and
disappeared in the forest, leaving the crow to whirl around in the air once or twice and then sink
slowly down, with some of his own torn feathers floating near him as witnesses to his defeat.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/111.jpg" alt="Policeman Blue Jay punishes
Jim"><br>POLICEMAN BLUE JAY PUNISHES JIM</p>
<p>The attack had dazed and astonished him beyond measure; but he found he was not much hurt,
after all. Crows are tougher than most birds. Jim managed to reach one of the brooks, where he
bathed his breast in the cool water, and soon he felt much refreshed and more like his old self
again.</p>
<p>But he decided not to go to the oriole's nest that morning, but to search for grabs and beetles
amongst the mosses beneath the oak-trees.</p>

<h2>Jim Crow Fools the Policeman</h2>
<p><font size="+4">F</font><font size="+2">ROM</font> that time on Policeman Blue Jay made
his home in the forest, keeping a sharp eye upon the actions of Jim Crow. And one day he flew
away to the southward and returned with Mrs. Blue Jay, who was even more beautiful than her
mate. Together they built a fine nest in a tree that stood near to the crow's tall pine, and soon after
they had settled down to housekeeping Mrs. Blue Jay began to lay eggs of a pretty brown color
mottled with darker brown specks.</p>
<p>Had Jim Crow known what was best for him he would have flown away from this forest and
found himself a new home. Within a short flight were many bits of woodland where a crow might
get a good living and not be bothered by blue jays. But Jim was obstinate and foolish, and had
made up his mind that he never would again be happy until he had been revenged upon his
enemy.</p>
<p>He dared no longer rob the nests so boldly as he had before, so he became sly and cunning. He
soon found out that the Blue Jay could not fly as high as he could, nor as fast; so, if he kept a sharp
lookout for the approach of his foe, he had no trouble in escaping. But if he went near to the nests
of the smaller birds, there was the blue policeman standing guard, and ready and anxious to fight at
a moment's notice. It was really no place for a robber at all, unless the robber was clever.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/115.jpg" alt="Jim disguises himself"><br>JIM DISGUISES
HIMSELF</p>
<p>One day Jim Crow discovered a chalkpit among the rocks at the north of the forest, just beyond
the edge of trees. The chalk was soft and in some places crumbled to a fine powder, so that when
he had rolled himself for a few minutes in the dust all his feathers became as white as snow. This
fact gave to Jim Crow a bright idea. No longer black, but white as a dove, he flew away to the
forest and passed right by Policeman Blue Jay, who only noticed that a big white bird had flown
amongst the trees, and did not suspect it was the thieving crow in a clever disguise.</p>
<p>Jim found a robin's nest that was not protected, both the robin and his wife being away in
search of food. So he ate up the eggs and kicked the nest to pieces and then flew away again,
passing the Blue Jay a second time all unnoticed.</p>
<p>When he reached a brook he washed all the chalk away from his feathers and then returned to
his nest as black as ever.</p>
<p>All the birds were angry and dismayed when they found what had happened, but none could
imagine who had robbed the robins. Mrs. Robin, who was not easily discouraged, built another nest
and laid more eggs in it; but the next day a second nest in the forest was robbed, and then another
and another, until the birds complained that Policeman Blue Jay did not protect them at all.</p>
<p>"I can't understand it in the least," said the policeman, "for I have watched carefully, and I
know Jim Crow has never dared to come near to your trees."</p>
<p>"Then some one else is the robber," declared the thrush fussily.</p>
<p>"The only stranger I have noticed around here is a big white bird," replied the Blue Jay, "and
white birds never rob nests or eat eggs, as you all know very well."</p>
<p>So they were no nearer the truth than before, and the thefts continued; for each day Jim Crow
would make himself white in the chalk-pit, fly into the forest and destroy the precious eggs of some
innocent little bird, and afterward wash himself in some far-away brook, and return to his nest
chuckling with glee to think he had fooled the Blue Jay so nicely.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/119.jpg" alt="Policeman Blue Jay discovers the
culprit"><br>POLICEMAN BLUE JAY DISCOVERS THE CULPRIT</p>
<p>But the Blue Jay, although stupid and unsuspecting at first, presently began to get a little
wisdom. He remembered that all this trouble had commenced when the strange white bird first
arrived in the forest; and although it was doubtless true that white birds never eat eggs and have
honest reputations, he decided to watch this stranger and make sure that it was innocent of the
frightful crimes that had so aroused the dwellers in the forest.</p>

<br><br><br>

<hr width="10%">
<h2>Jim Crow is Punished</h2>
<p><font size="+4">S</font><font size="+2">O</font> one day Policeman Blue Jay hid himself in
some thick bushes until he saw the big white bird fly by, and then he followed quietly after it,
flitting from tree to tree and keeping out of sight as much as possible, until at last he saw the white
bird alight near a bullfinch's nest and eat up all the eggs it contained.</p>
<p>Then, ruffling his crest angrily, Policeman Blue Jay flew to attack the big white robber, and was
astonished to find he could not catch it. For the white bird flew higher into the air than he could,
and also flew much faster, so that it soon escaped and passed out of sight.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/122.jpg" alt="The birds of the forest"><br>THE BIRDS OF
THE FOREST</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/123.jpg" alt="are revenged on Jim"><br>ARE REVENGED
ON JIM</p>
<p>"It must be a white crow," thought the Blue Jay; "for only a crow can beat me at flying, and
some of that race are said to be white, although I have never seen one."</p>
<p>So he called together all the birds, and told them what he had seen, and they all agreed to hide
themselves the next day and lie in wait for the thief.</p>
<p>By this time Jim Crow thought himself perfectly safe, and success had made him as bold as he
was wicked. Therefore he suspected nothing when, after rolling himself in the chalk, he flew down
the next day into the forest to feast upon birds' eggs. He soon came to a pretty nest, and was just
about to rob it, when a chorus of shrill cries arose on every side of him and hundreds of
birds&mdash;so many that they quite filled the air&mdash;flew straight at the white one, pecking
him with their bills and striking him with their wings; for anger had made even the most timid of the
little birds fierce, and there were so many of them that they gave each other courage.</p>
<p>Jim Crow tried to escape, but whichever way he might fly his foes clustered all around him,
getting in his way so that he could not use his big wings properly. And all the time they were
pecking at him and fighting him as hard as they could. Also, the chalk was brushed from his
feathers, by degrees, and soon the birds were able to recognize their old enemy the crow, and then,
indeed, they became more furious than ever.</p>
<p>Policeman Blue Jay was especially angry at the deception practiced upon him, and if he could
have got at the crow just then he would have killed it instantly. But the little birds were all in his
way, so he was forced to hold aloof.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/127.jpg" alt="The birds bear water to Jim"><br>THE BIRDS
BEAR WATER TO JIM</p>
<p>Filled with terror and smarting with pain, Jim Crow had only one thought: to get to the shelter of
his nest in the pine-tree. In some way he managed to do this, and to sink exhausted into the hollow
of his nest. But many of his enemies followed him, and although the thick feathers of his back and
wings protected his body, Jim's head and eyes were at the mercy of the sharp bills of the vengeful
birds.</p>
<p>When at last they left him, thinking he had been sufficiently punished, Jim Crow was as nearly
dead as a bird could be. But crows are tough, and this one was unlucky enough to remain alive. For
when his wounds had healed he had become totally blind, and day after day he sat in his nest,
helpless and alone, and dared not leave it.</p>

<h2>Jim Crow Has Time to Repent His Sins</h2>
<p><font size="+4">"W</font><font size="+2">HERE</font> are you going, my dear?" asked the
Blue Jay of his wife.</p>
<p>"I'm going to carry some grubs to Jim Crow," she answered. "I'll be back in a minute."</p>
<p>"Jim Crow is a robber and a murderer!" said the policeman, harshly.</p>
<p>"I know," she replied, in a sweet voice; "but he is blind."</p>
<p>"Well, fly along," said her husband; "but hurry back again."</p>
<p>And the robin-redbreast and his wife filled a cup-shaped flower with water from the brook, and
then carried it in their bills to the pine-tree, without spilling a drop.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" asked the oriole, as they passed.</p>
<p>"We're just taking some water to Jim Crow," replied Mrs. Robin.</p>
<p>"He's a thief and a scoundrel!" cried the oriole, indignantly.</p>
<p>"That is true." said Mrs. Robin, in a soft, pitiful voice; "but he is blind."</p>
<p>"Let me help you." exclaimed the oriole. "I'll carry this side of the cup, so it can't tip."</p>
<p>So Jim Crow, blind and helpless, sat in his nest day after day and week after week, while the
little birds he had so cruelly wronged brought him food and water and cared for him as generously
as they could.</p>
<p>And I wonder what his thoughts were&mdash;don't you?</p>

<h2>The Picnic</h2>
<p><font size="+4">O</font><font size="+2">N</font> the great western prairies of Dakota is a
little town called Edgeley, because it is on the edge of civilization&mdash;a very big word which
means some folks have found a better way to live than other folks. The Edgeley people have a
good way to live, for there are almost seventeen wooden houses there, and among them is a school-
house, a church, a store and a blacksmith-shop. If people walked out their front doors they were
upon the little street; if they walked out the back doors they were on the broad prairies. That was
why Twinkle, who was a farmer's little girl, lived so near the town that she could easily walk to
school.</p>
<p>She was a pretty, rosy-cheeked little thing, with long, fluffy hair, and big round eyes that
everybody smiled into when they saw them. It was hard to keep that fluffy hair from getting
tangled; so mamma used to tie it in the back with a big, broad ribbon. And Twinkle wore calico
slips for school days and gingham dresses when she wanted to "dress up" or look especially nice.
And to keep the sun from spotting her face with freckles, she wore sunbonnets made of the same
goods as her dresses.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/139.jpg" alt="Chubbins"><br>CHUBBINS</p>
<p>Twinkle's best chum was a little boy called Chubbins, who was the only child of the tired-faced
school-teacher. Chubbins was about as old as Twinkle; but he wasn't so tall and slender for his age
as she was, being short and rather fat. The hair on his little round head was cut close, and he
usually wore a shirt-waist and "knickers," with a wide straw hat on the back of his head. Chubbins's
face was very solemn. He never said many words when grown folks were around, but he could talk
fast enough when he and Twinkle were playing together alone.</p>
<p>Well, one Saturday the school had a picnic, and Twinkle and Chubbins both went. On the
Dakota prairies there are no shade-trees at all, and very little water except what they they get by
boring deep holes in the ground; so you may wonder where the people could possibly have a
picnic. But about three miles from the town a little stream of water (which they called a "river," but
we would call only a brook) ran slow and muddy across the prairie; and where the road crossed it a
flat bridge had been built. If you climbed down the banks of the river you would find a nice shady
place under the wooden bridge; and so here it was that the picnics were held.</p>
<p>All the village went to the picnic, and they started bright and early in the morning, with horses
and farm-wagons, and baskets full of good things to eat, and soon arrived at the bridge.</p>
<p>There was room enough in its shade for all to be comfortable; so they unhitched the horses and
carried the baskets to the river bank, and began to laugh and be as merry as they could.</p>
<p>Twinkle and Chubbins, however, didn't care much for the shade of the bridge. This was a
strange place to them, so they decided to explore it and see if it was any different from any other
part of the prairie. Without telling anybody where they were going, they took hold of hands and
trotted across the bridge and away into the plains on the other side.</p>
<p>The ground here wasn't flat, but had long rolls to it, like big waves on the ocean, so that as soon
as the little girl and boy had climbed over the top of the first wave, or hill, those by the river lost
sight of them.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/143.jpg" alt="Twinkle and Chubbins start to
explore"><br>TWINKLE AND CHUBBINS START TO EXPLORE</p>
<p>They saw nothing but grass in the first hollow, but there was another hill just beyond, so they
kept going, and climbed over that too. And now they found, lying in the second hollow, one of the
most curious sights that the western prairies afford.</p>
<p>"What is it?" asked Chubbins, wonderingly.</p>
<p>"Why, it's a Prairie-Dog Town," said Twinkle.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/144.jpg" alt="A prarie-dog"></p>




<br><br><br>

<hr width="10%">
<h2>Prarie-Dog Town</h2>
<p><font size="+4">L</font><font size="+2">YING</font> in every direction, and quite filling the
little hollow, were round mounds of earth, each one having a hole in the center. The mounds were
about two feet high and as big around as a wash-tub, and the edges of the holes were pounded hard
and smooth by the pattering feet of the little creatures that lived within.</p>
<p>"Isn't it funny!" said Chubbins, staring at the mounds.</p>
<p>"Awful," replied Twinkle, staring too. "Do you know, Chub, there are an'mals living in every
single one of those holes?"</p>
<p>"What kind?" asked Chubbins.</p>
<p>"Well, they're something like squirrels, only they <i>aren't</i> squirrels," she explained.
"They're prairie-dogs."</p>
<p>"Don't like dogs," said the boy, looking a bit uneasy.</p>
<p>"Oh, they're not dogs at all," said Twinkle; "they're soft and fluffy, and gentle."</p>
<p>"Do they bark?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes; but they don't bite."</p>
<p>"How d' you know, Twink?"</p>
<p>"Papa has told me about them, lots of times. He says they're so shy that they run into their holes
when anybody's around; but if you keep quiet and watch, they'll stick their heads out in a few
minutes."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/147.jpg" alt="Watching"><br>WATCHING</p>
<p>"Let's watch," said Chubbins.</p>
<p>"All right," she agreed.</p>
<p>Very near to some of the mounds was a raised bank, covered with soft grass; so the children
stole softly up to this bank and lay down upon it in such a way that their heads just stuck over the
top of it, while their bodies were hidden from the eyes of any of the folks of Prairie-Dog
Town.</p>
<p>"Are you comferble, Chub?" asked the little girl.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then lie still and don't talk, and keep your eyes open, and perhaps the an'mals will stick their
heads up."</p>
<p>"All right," says Chubbins.</p>
<p>So they kept quiet and waited, and it seemed a long time to both the boy and the girl before a
soft, furry head popped out of a near-by hole, and two big, gentle brown eyes looked at them
curiously.</p>

<h2>Mr. Bowko, the Mayor</h2>
<p><font size="+4">"D</font><font size="+2">EAR</font> me!" said the prairie-dog, speaking
almost in a whisper; "here are some of those queer humans from the village."</p>
<p>"Let me see! Let me see!" cried two shrill little voices, and the wee heads of two small creatures
popped out of the hole and fixed their bright eyes upon the heads of Twinkle and Chubbins.</p>
<p>"Go down at once!" said the mother prairie-dog. "Do you want to get hurt, you naughty little
things?"</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/151.jpg" alt="&quot;Go down at once!&quot;"><br>"GO
DOWN AT ONCE!"</p>
<p>"Oh, they won't get hurt," said another deeper voice, and the children turned their eyes toward a
second mound, on top of which sat a plump prairie-dog whose reddish fur was tipped with white
on the end of each hair. He seemed to be quite old, or at least well along in years, and he had a
wise and thoughtful look on his face.</p>
<p>"They're humans," said the mother.</p>
<p>"True enough; but they're only human children, and wouldn't hurt your little ones for the
world," the old one said.</p>
<p>"That's so!" called Twinkle. "All we want, is to get acquainted."</p>
<p>"Why, in that case," replied the old prairie-dog, "you are very welcome in our town, and we're
glad to see you."</p>
<p>"Thank you," said Twinkle, gratefully. It didn't occur to her just then that it was wonderful to be
talking to the little prairie-dogs just as if they were people. It seemed very natural they should speak
with each other and be friendly.</p>
<p>As if attracted by the sound of voices, little heads began to pop out of the other
mounds&mdash;one here and one there&mdash;until the town was alive with the pretty creatures,
all squatting near the edges of their holes and eyeing Chubbins and Twinkle with grave and curious
looks.</p>
<p>"Let me introduce myself," said the old one that had first proved friendly. "My name is Bowko,
and I'm the Mayor and High Chief of Prairie-Dog Town."</p>
<p>"Don't you have a king?" asked Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Not in this town," he answered. "There seems to be no place for kings in this free United
States. And a Mayor and High Chief is just as good as a king, any day."</p>
<p>"I think so, too," answered the girl.</p>
<p>"Better!" declared Chubbins.</p>
<p>The Mayor smiled, as if pleased.</p>
<p>"I see you've been properly brought up," he continued; "and now let me introduce to you some
of my fellow-citizens. This," pointing with one little paw to the hole where the mother and her two
children were sitting, "is Mrs. Puff-Pudgy and her family&mdash;Teenty and Weenty. Mr. Puff-
Pudgy, I regret to say, was recently chased out of town for saying his prayers backwards."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/155.jpg" alt="Mr. Puff-Pudgy would say his prayers
backward"><br>MR. PUFF-PUDGY WOULD SAY HIS PRAYERS BACKWARD</p>
<p>"How could he?" asked Chubbins, much surprised.</p>
<p>"He was always contrary," answered the Mayor, with a sigh, "and wouldn't do things the same
way that others did. His good wife, Mrs. Puff-Pudgy, had to scold him all day long; so we finally
made him leave the town, and I don't know where he's gone to."</p>
<p>"Won't he be sorry not to have his little children any more?" asked Twinkle, regretfully.</p>
<p>"I suppose so; but if people are contrary, and won't behave, they must take the consequences.
This is Mr. Chuckledorf," continued the Mayor, and a very fat prairie-dog bowed to them most
politely; "and here is Mrs. Fuzcum; and Mrs. Chatterby; and Mr. Sneezeley, and Doctor
Dosem."</p>
<p>All these folks bowed gravely and politely, and Chubbins and Twinkle bobbed their heads in
return until their necks ached, for it seemed as if the Mayor would never get through introducing
the hundreds of prairie-dogs that were squatting around.</p>
<p>"I'll never be able to tell one from the other," whispered the girl; "'cause they all look exactly
alike."</p>
<p>"Some of 'em's fatter," observed Chubbins; "but I don't know which."</p>

have you visit some of our houses," said Mr. Bowko, the Mayor, in a friendly tone.</p>
<p>"But we can't!" exclaimed Twinkle. "We're too big," and she got up and sat down upon the
bank, to show him how big she really was when compared with the prairie-dogs.</p>
<p>"Oh, that doesn't matter in the least," the Mayor replied. "I'll have Presto Digi, our magician,
reduce you to our size."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/159.jpg" alt="Mr. Bowko, the Mayor"><br>MR. BOWKO,
THE MAYOR</p>
<p>"Can he?" asked Twinkle, doubtfully.</p>
<p>"Our magician can do anything," declared the Mayor. Then he sat up and put both his front
paws to his mouth and made a curious sound that was something like a bark and something like a
whistle, but not exactly like either one.</p>
<p>Then everybody waited in silence until a queer old prairie-dog slowly put his head out of a big
mound near the center of the village.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Mr. Presto Digi," said the Mayor.</p>
<p>"Morning!" answered the magician, blinking his eyes as if he had just awakened from
sleep.</p>
<p>Twinkle nearly laughed at this scrawny, skinny personage; but by good fortune, for she didn't
wish to offend him, she kept her face straight and did not even smile.</p>
<p>"We have two guests here, this morning," continued the Mayor, addressing the magician, "who
are a little too large to get into our houses. So, as they are invited to stay to luncheon, it would
please us all if you would kindly reduce them to fit our underground rooms."</p>
<p>"Is <i>that</i> all you want?" asked Mr. Presto Digi, bobbing his head at the children.</p>
<p>"It seems to me a great deal," answered Twinkle. "I'm afraid you never could do it."</p>
<p>"Wow!" said the magician, in a scornful voice that was almost a bark. "I can do that with one
paw. Come here to me, and don't step on any of our mounds while you're so big and clumsy."</p>
<p>So Twinkle and Chubbins got up and walked slowly toward the magician, taking great care
where they stepped. Teenty and Weenty were frightened, and ducked their heads with little squeals
as the big children passed their mound; but they bobbed up again the next moment, being curious to
see what would happen.</p>
<p>When the boy and girl stopped before Mr. Presto Digi's mound, he began waving one of his
thin, scraggy paws and at the same time made a gurgling noise that was deep down in his throat.
And his eyes rolled and twisted around in a very odd way.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/163.jpg" alt="Mr. Presto Digi works magic"><br>MR. PRESTO
DIGI WORKS MAGIC</p>
<p>Neither Twinkle nor Chubbins felt any effect from the magic, nor any different from ordinary;
but they knew they were growing smaller, because their eyes were getting closer to the
magician.</p>
<p>"Is that enough?" asked Mr. Presto, after a while.</p>
<p>"Just a little more, please," replied the Mayor; "I don't want them to bump their heads against the
doorways."</p>
<p>So the magician again waved his paw and chuckled and gurgled and blinked, until Twinkle
suddenly found she had to look up at him as he squatted on his mound.</p>
<p>"Stop!" she screamed; "if you keep on, we won't be anything at all!"</p>
<p>"You're just about the right size," said the Mayor, looking them over with much pleasure, and
when the girl turned around she found Mr. Bowko and Mrs. Puff-Pudgy standing beside her, and
she could easily see that Chubbins was no bigger than they, and she was no bigger than
Chubbins.</p>
<p>"Kindly follow me," said Mrs. Puff-Pudgy, "for my little darlings are anxious to make your
acquaintance, and as I was the first to discover you, you are to be my guests first of all, and
afterward go to the Mayor's to luncheon."</p>

<hr width="10%">
<h2>The Home of the Puff-Pudgys</h2>
<p><font size="+4">S</font><font size="+2">O</font> Twinkle and Chubbins, still holding hands,
trotted along to the Puff-Pudgy mound, and it was strange how rough the ground now seemed to
their tiny feet. They climbed up the slope of the mound rather clumsily, and when they came to the
hole it seemed to them as big as a well. Then they saw that it wasn't a deep hole, but a sort of tunnel
leading down hill into the mound, and Twinkle knew if they were careful they were not likely to
slip or tumble down.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/167.jpg" alt="The ground now seemed rough to their tiny
feet"><br>THE GROUND NOW SEEMED ROUGH TO THEIR TINY FEET</p>
<p>Mrs. Puff-Pudgy popped into the hole like a flash, for she was used to it, and waited just below
the opening to guide them. So, Twinkle slipped down to the floor of the tunnel and Chubbins
followed close after her, and then they began to go downward.</p>
<p>"It's a little dark right here," said Mrs. Puff-Pudgy; "but I've ordered the maid to light the candles
for you, so you'll see well enough when you're in the rooms."</p>
<p>"Thank you," said Twinkle, walking along the hall and feeling her way by keeping her hand
upon the smooth sides of the passage. "I hope you won't go to any trouble, or put on airs, just
because we've come to visit you."</p>
<p>"If I do," replied Mrs. Puffy-Pudgy, "it's because I know the right way to treat company. We've
always belonged to the 'four hundred,' you know. Some folks never know what to do, or how to do
it, but that isn't the way with the Puff-Pudgys. Hi! you, Teenty and Weenty&mdash;get out of here
and behave yourselves! You'll soon have a good look at our visitors."</p>
<p>And now they came into a room so comfortable and even splendid that Twinkle's eyes opened
wide with amazement.</p>
<p>It was big, and of a round shape, and on the walls were painted very handsome portraits of
different prairie-dogs of the Puff-Pudgy family. The furniture was made of white clay, baked hard
in the sun and decorated with paints made from blue clay and red clay and yellow clay. This gave it
a gorgeous appearance. There was a round table in the middle of the room, and several comfortable
chairs and sofas. Around the walls were little brackets with candles in them, lighting the place very
pleasantly.</p>
<p>"Sit down, please," said Mrs. Puff-Pudgy. "You'll want to rest a minute before I show you
around."</p>
<p>So Twinkle and Chubbins sat upon the pretty clay chairs, and Teenty and Weenty sat opposite
them and stared with their mischievous round eyes as hard as they could.</p>
<p>"What nice furniture," exclaimed the girl.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Puff-Pudgy, looking up at the picture of a sad-faced prairie-dog; "Mr. Puff-
Pudgy made it all himself. He was very handy at such things. It's a shame he turned out so
obstinate."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/171.jpg" alt="Mr. Puff-Pudgy's portrait"><br>MR. PUFF-
PUDGY'S PORTRAIT</p>
<p>"Did he build the house too?"</p>
<p>"Why, he dug it out, if that's what you mean. But I advised him how to do it, so I deserve some
credit for it myself. Next to the Mayor's, it's the best house in town, which accounts for our high
social standing. Weenty! take your paw out of your mouth. You're biting your claws again."</p>
<p>"I'm not!" said Weenty.</p>
<p>"And now," continued Mrs. Puff-Pudgy, "if you are rested, I'll show you through the rest of our
house."</p>
<p>So, they got up and followed her, and she led the children through an archway into the dining-
room. Here was a cupboard full of the cunningest little dishes Twinkle had ever seen. They were all
made of clay, baked hard in the sun, and were of graceful shapes, and nearly as smooth and
perfect as our own dishes.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/173.jpg" alt="A prarie-dog"></p>


<br><br><br>
<h1><a name="3-6">Chapter VI</a></h1>
<hr width="10%">
<h2>Teenty and Weenty</h2>
<p><font size="+4">A</font><font size="+2">LL</font> around the sides of the dining-room were
pockets, or bins, in the wall; and these were full of those things the prairie-dogs are most fond of
eating. Clover-seeds filled one bin, and sweet roots another; dried mulberry leaves&mdash;that
must have come from a long distance&mdash;were in another bin, and even kernels of yellow field
corn were heaped in one place. The Puff-Pudgys were surely in no danger of starving for some
time to come.</p>
<p>"Teenty! Put back that grain of wheat," commanded the mother, in a severe voice.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/175.jpg" alt="The children examine the dining-
room"><br>THE CHILDREN EXAMINE THE DINING-ROOM</p>
<p>Instead of obeying, Teenty put the wheat in his mouth and ate it as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>"The little dears are <i>so</i> restless," Mrs. Puff-Pudgy said to Twinkle, "that it's hard to
manage them."</p>
<p>"They don't behave," remarked Chubbins, staring hard at the children.</p>
<p>"No, they have a share of their father's obstinate nature," replied Mrs. Puff-Pudgy. "Excuse me
a minute and I'll cuff them; It'll do them good."</p>
<p>But before their mother could reach them, the children found trouble of their own. Teenty
sprang at Weenty and began to fight, because his brother had pinched him, and Weenty fought
back with all his might and main. They scratched with their claws and bit with their teeth, and rolled
over and over upon the floor, bumping into the wall and upsetting the chairs, and snarling and
growling all the while like two puppies.</p>
<p>Mrs. Puff-Pudgy sat down and watched them, but did not interfere.</p>
<p>"Won't they hurt themselves?" asked Twinkle, anxiously.</p>
<p>"Perhaps so," said the mother; "but if they do, it will punish them for being so naughty. I always
let them fight it out, because they are so sore for a day or two afterward that they have to keep
quiet, and then I get a little rest."</p>
<p>Weenty set up a great howling, just then, and Teenty drew away from his defeated brother and
looked at him closely. The fur on both of them was badly mussed up, and Weenty had a long
scratch on his nose, that must have hurt him, or he wouldn't have howled so. Teenty's left eye was
closed tight, but if it hurt him he bore the pain in silence.</p>
<p>Mrs. Puff-Pudgy now pushed them both into a little room and shut them up, saying they must
stay there until bedtime; and then she led Twinkle and Chubbins into the kitchen and showed them
a pool of clear water, in a big clay basin, that had been caught during the last rain and saved for
drinking purposes. The children drank of it, and found it cool and refreshing.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/179.jpg" alt="The quarrel"><br>THE QUARREL</p>
<p>Then they saw the bedrooms, and learned that the beds of prairie-dogs were nothing more than
round hollows made in heaps of clay. These animals always curl themselves up when they sleep,
and the round hollows just fitted their bodies; so, no doubt, they found them very comfortable.</p>
<p>There were several bedrooms, for the Puff-Pudgy house was really very large. It was also very
cool and pleasant, being all underground and not a bit damp.</p>
<p>After they had admired everything in a way that made Mrs. Puff-Pudgy very proud and happy,
their hostess took one of the lighted candles from a bracket and said she would now escort them to
the house of the Honorable Mr. Bowko, the Mayor.</p>
<p></p>

<br><br><br>

<hr width="10%">
<h2>The Mayor Gives a Luncheon</h2>
<p><font size="+4">"D</font><font size="+2">ON'T</font> we have to go upstairs and out of
doors?" asked Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," replied the prairie-dog, "we have halls connecting all the different houses of
importance. Just follow me, and you can't get lost."</p>
<p>They might easily have been lost without their guide, the little girl thought, after they had gone
through several winding passages. They turned this way and that, in quite a bewildering manner,
and there were so many underground tunnels going in every direction that it was a wonder Mrs.
Puff-Pudgy knew which way to go.</p>
<p>"You ought to have sign-posts," said Chubbins, who had once been in a city.</p>
<p>"Why, as for that, every one in the town knows which way to go," answered their guide; "and it
isn't often we have visitors. Last week a gray owl stopped with us for a couple of days, and we had
a fine ball in her honor. But you are the first humans that have ever been entertained in our town,
so it's quite an event with us." A few minutes later she said: "Here we are, at the Mayor's house,"
and as they passed under a broad archway she blew out her candle, because the Mayor's house was
so brilliantly lighted.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/183.jpg" alt="The luncheon at the mayor's"><br>THE
LUNCHEON AT THE MAYOR'S</p>
<p>"Welcome!" said Mr. Bowko, greeting the children with polite bows. "You are just in time, for
luncheon is about ready and my guests are waiting for you."</p>
<p>He led them at once into a big dining-room that was so magnificently painted with colored clays
that the walls were as bright as a June rainbow.</p>
<p>"How pretty!" cried Twinkle, clapping her hands together in delight.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you like it," said the Mayor, much pleased. "Some people, who are lacking in good
taste, think it's a little overdone, but a Mayor's house should be gorgeous, I think, so as to be a
credit to the community. My grandfather, who designed and painted this house, was a very fine
artist. But luncheon is ready, so pray be seated."</p>
<p>They sat down on little clay chairs that were placed at the round table. The Mayor sat on one
side of Twinkle and Mrs. Puff-Pudgy on the other, and Chubbins was between the skinny old
magician and Mr. Sneezeley. Also, in other chairs sat Dr. Dosem, and Mrs. Chatterby, and Mrs.
Fuzcum, and several others. It was a large company, indeed, which showed that the Mayor
considered this a very important occasion.</p>
<p>They were waited upon by several sleek prairie-dog maids in white aprons and white caps, who
looked neat and respectable, and were very graceful in their motions.</p>
<p>Neither Twinkle nor Chubbins was very hungry, but they were curious to know what kind of
food the prairie-dogs ate, so they watched carefully when the different dishes were passed around.
Only grains and vegetables were used, for prairie-dogs do not eat meat. There was a milk-weed
soup at first; and then yellow corn, boiled and sliced thin. Afterward they had a salad of thistle
leaves, and some bread made of barley. The dessert was a dish of the sweet, dark honey made by
prairie-bees, and some cakes flavored with sweet and spicy roots that only prairie-dogs know how
to find.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/187.jpg" alt="Mrs. Fuzcum singing"><br>MRS. FUZCUM
SINGING</p>
<p>The children tasted of several dishes, just to show their politeness; but they couldn't eat much.
Chubbins spent most of his time watching Mr. Presto Digi, who ate up everything that was near him
and seemed to be as hungry after the luncheon as he had been before.</p>
<p>Mrs. Puff-Pudgy talked so much about the social standing and dignity of the Puff-Pudgys that
she couldn't find time to eat much, although she asked for the recipe of the milk-weed soup. But
most of the others present paid strict attention to the meal and ate with very good appetites.</p>

<hr width="10%">
<h2>On Top of the Earth Again</h2>
<p><font size="+4">A</font><font size="+2">FTERWARD</font> they all went into the big
drawing-room, where Mrs. Fuzcum sang a song for them in a very shrill voice, and Mr. Sneezeley
and Mrs. Chatterby danced a graceful minuet that was much admired by all present.</p>
<p>"We ought to be going home," said Twinkle, after this entertainment was over. "I'm afraid our
folks will worry about us."</p>
<p>"We regret to part with you," replied the Mayor; "but, if you really think you ought to go, we
will not be so impolite as to urge you to stay."</p>
<p>"You'll find we have excellent manners," added Mrs. Puff-Pudgy.</p>
<p>"I want to get big again," said Chubbins.</p>
<p>"Very well; please step this way," said the Mayor.</p>
<p>So they all followed him through a long passage until they began to go upward, as if climbing a
hill. And then a gleam of daylight showed just ahead of them, and a few more steps brought them
to the hole in the middle of the mound.</p>
<p>The Mayor and Mrs. Puff-Pudgy jumped up first, and then they helped Twinkle and Chubbins
to scramble out. The strong sunlight made them blink their eyes for a time, but when they were able
to look around they found one or more heads of prairie-dogs sticking from every mound.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/191.jpg" alt="&quot;Do you think we've been
asleep?&quot;"><br>"DO YOU THINK WE'VE BEEN ASLEEP?"</p>
<p>"Now, Mr. Presto Digi," said the Mayor, when all the party were standing on the ground, "please
enlarge our friends to their natural sizes again."</p>
<p>"That is very easy," said the magician, with a sigh. "I really wish, Mr. Mayor, that you would
find something for me to do that is difficult."</p>
<p>"I will, some time," promised the Mayor. "Just now, this is all I can require of you."</p>
<p>So the magician waved his paw and gurgled, much in the same way he had done before, and
Twinkle and Chubbins began to grow, and swell out until they were as large as ever, and the prairie-
dogs again seemed very small beside them.</p>
<p>"Good-bye," said the little girl, "and thank you all, very much, for your kindness to us."</p>
<p>"Good-bye!" answered a chorus of small voices, and then all the prairie-dogs popped into their
holes and quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>Twinkle and Chubbins found they were sitting on the green bank again, at the edge of Prairie-
Dog Town.</p>
<p>"Do you think we've been asleep, Chub?" asked the girl.</p>
<p>"'Course not," replied Chubbins, with a big yawn. "It's easy 'nough to know that, Twink, 'cause
I'm sleepy now!"</p>

<h2>Twinkle Captures the Turtle</h2>
<p><font size="+4">O</font><font size="+2">NE</font> hot summer day Twinkle went down into
the meadow to where the brook ran tinkling over its stones or rushed and whirled around the curves
of the banks or floated lazily through the more wide and shallow parts. It wasn't much of a brook,
to tell the facts, for there were many places where an active child could leap across it. But it was the
only brook for miles around, and to Twinkle it was a never-ending source of delight. Nothing
amused or refreshed the little girl more than to go wading on the pebbly bottom and let the little
waves wash around her slim ankles.</p>
<p>There was one place, just below the pasture lot, where it was deeper; and here there were real
fishes swimming about, such as "horned aces" and "chubs" and "shiners"; and once in a while you
could catch a mud-turtle under the edges of the flat stones or in hollows beneath the banks. The
deep part was not very big, being merely a pool, but Twinkle never waded in it, because the water
would come quite up to her waist, and then she would be sure to get her skirts wet, which would
mean a good scolding from mamma.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/201.jpg" alt="Twinkle prepares to go wading"><br>TWINKLE
PREPARES TO GO WADING</p>
<p>To-day she climbed the fence in the lane, just where the rickety wooden bridge crossed the
brook, and at once sat down upon the grassy bank and took off her shoes and stockings. Then,
wearing her sun-bonnet to shield her face from the sun, she stepped softly into the brook and stood
watching the cool water rush by her legs.</p>
<p>It was very nice and pleasant; but Twinkle never could stand still for very long, so she began to
wade slowly down the stream, keeping in the middle of the brook, and being able to see through the
clear water all the best places to put her feet.</p>
<p>Pretty soon she had to duck her head to pass under the fence that separated the meadow from
the pasture lot; but she got through all right, and then kept on down the stream, until she came close
to the deep pool. She couldn't wade through this, as I have explained; so she got on dry land and
crept on her hands and knees up to the edge of the bank, so as not to scare the fishes, if any were
swimming in the pool.</p>
<p>By good luck there were several fishes in the pool to-day, and they didn't seem to notice that
Twinkle was looking at them, so quiet had she been. One little fellow shone like silver when the
sunshine caught his glossy sides, and the little girl watched him wiggling here and there with much
delight. There was also a big, mud-colored fish that lay a long time upon the bottom without
moving anything except his fins and the tip of his tail, and Twinkle also discovered a group of
several small fishes not over an inch long, that always swam together in a bunch, as if they
belonged to one family.</p>
<p>The girl watched these little creatures long and earnestly. The pool was all of the world these
simple fishes would ever know. They were born here, and would die here, without ever getting
away from the place, or even knowing there was a much bigger world outside of it.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/205.jpg" alt="Twinkle captures the turtle"><br>TWINKLE
CAPTURES THE TURTLE</p>
<p>After a time the child noticed that the water had become a little muddy near the edge of the
bank where she lay, and as it slowly grew clear again she saw a beautiful turtle lying just under her
head and against the side of the bank. It was a little bigger around than a silver dollar, and instead
of its shell being of a dull brown color, like that of all other mud-turtles she had seen, this one's
back was streaked with brilliant patches of yellow and red.</p>
<p>"I must get that lovely turtle!" thought Twinkle; and as the water was shallow where it lay she
suddenly plunged in her hand, grabbed the turtle, and flung it out of the water on to the bank,
where it fell upon its back, wiggling its four fat legs desperately in an attempt to turn over.</p>

<br><br><br>

<h2>Twinkle Discovers the Turtle Can Talk</h2>
<p><font size="+4">A</font><font size="+2">T</font> this sudden commotion in their water, the
fishes darted away and disappeared in a flash. But Twinkle didn't mind that, for all her interest was
now centered in the struggling turtle.</p>
<p>She knelt upon the grass and bent over to watch it, and just then she thought she heard a small
voice say:</p>
<p>"It's no use; I can't do it!" and then the turtle drew its head and legs between the shells and
remained still.</p>
<p>"Good gracious!" said Twinkle, much astonished. Then, addressing the turtle, she asked:</p>
<p>"Did you say anything, a minute ago?"</p>
<p>There was no reply. The turtle lay as quiet as if it were dead. Twinkle thought she must have
been mistaken; so she picked up the turtle and held it in the palm of her hand while she got into the
water again and waded slowly back to where she had left her shoes and stockings.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/209.jpg" alt="Twinkle watching the turtle"><br>TWINKLE
WATCHING THE TURTLE</p>
<p>When she got home she put the mud-turtle in a tub which her papa had made by sawing a barrel
in two. Then she put a little water into the tub and blocked it up by putting a brick under one side,
so that the turtle could either stay in the water or crawl up the inclined bottom of the tub to where it
was dry, whichever he pleased. She did this because mamma said that turtles sometimes liked to
stay in the water and sometimes on land, and Twinkle's turtle could now take his choice. He
couldn't climb up the steep sides of the tub and so get away, and the little girl thoughtfully placed
crumbs of bread and fine bits of meat, where the turtle could get them whenever he felt
hungry.</p>
<p>After that, Twinkle often sat for hours watching the turtle, which would crawl around the
bottom of the tub, and swim in the little pool of water and eat the food placed before him in an
eager and amusing way.</p>
<p>At times she took him in her hand and examined him closely, and then the mud-turtle would
put out its little head and look at her with its bright eyes as curiously as the girl looked at him.</p>
<p>She had owned her turtle just a week, when she came to the tub one afternoon and held him in
her hand, intending to feed her pet some scraps of meat she had brought with her. But as soon as
the turtle put out its head it said to her, in a small but distinct voice:</p>
<p>"Good morning, Twinkle."</p>
<p>She was so surprised that the meat dropped from her hand, and she nearly dropped the turtle,
too. But she managed to control her astonishment, and asked, in a voice that trembled a little:</p>
<p>"Can you talk?"</p>
<p>"To be sure," replied the turtle; "but only on every seventh day&mdash;which of course is
every Saturday. On other days I cannot talk at all."</p>
<p>"Then I really must have heard you speak when I caught you; didn't I?"</p>
<p>"I believe you did. I was so startled at being captured that I spoke before I thought, which is a
bad habit to get into. But afterward I resolved not to answer when you questioned me, for I didn't
know you then, and feared it would be unwise to trust you with my secret. Even now I must ask
you not to tell any one that you have a turtle that knows how to talk."</p>

<h2>The Turtle Tells of the Corrugated Giant</h2>
<p><font size="+4">"W</font><font size="+2">HY,</font> it's wonderful!" said Twinkle, who had
listened eagerly to the turtle's speech.</p>
<p>"It would be wonderful, indeed, if I were but a simple turtle," was the reply.</p>
<p>"But aren't you a turtle?"</p>
<p>"Of course, so far as my outward appearance goes, I'm a common little mud-turtle," it
answered; "and I think you will agree with me that it was rather clever in the Corrugated Giant to
transform me into such a creature."</p>
<p>"What's a Corrulated Giant?" asked Twinkle, with breathless interest.</p>
<p>"The Corrugated Giant is a monster that is full of deep wrinkles, because he has no bones inside
him to hold his flesh up properly," said the turtle. "I hated this giant, who is both wicked and cruel,
I assure you; and this giant hated me in return. So, when one day I tried to destroy him, the monster
transformed me into the helpless little being you see before you."</p>
<p>"But who were you before you were transformed?" asked the girl.</p>
<p>"A fairy prince named Melga, the seventh son of the fairy Queen Flutterlight, who rules all the
fairies in the north part of this land."</p>
<p>"And how long have you been a turtle?"</p>
<p>"Fourteen years," replied the creature, with a deep sigh. "At least, I think it is fourteen years; but
of course when one is swimming around in brooks and grubbing in the mud for food, one is apt to
lose all track of time."</p>
<p>"I should think so, indeed," said Twinkle. "But, according to that, you're older than I am."</p>
<p>"Much older," declared the turtle. "I had lived about four hundred years before the Corrugated
Giant turned me into a turtle."</p>
<p>"Was your head gray?" she asked; "and did you have white whiskers?"</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/217.jpg" alt="Queen Flutterlight"><br>QUEEN
FLUTTERLIGHT</p>
<p>"No, indeed!" said the turtle. "Fairies are always young and beautiful in appearance, no matter
how many years they have lived. And, as they never die, they're bound to get pretty old sometimes,
as a matter of course."</p>
<p>"Of course!" agreed Twinkle. "Mama has told me about the fairies. But must you always be a
mud-turtle?"</p>
<p>"That will depend on whether you are willing to help me or not," was the answer.</p>
<p>"Why, it sounds just like a fairy tale in a book!" cried the little girl.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the turtle, "these things have been happening ever since there were fairies, and
you might expect some of our adventures would get into books. But are you willing to help me?
That is the important thing just now."</p>
<p>"I'll do anything I can," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Then," said the turtle, "I may expect to get back to my own form again in a reasonably short
time. But you must be brave, and not shrink from such a little thing as danger."</p>
<p>That made Twinkle look solemn.</p>
<p>"Of course I don't want to get hurt," she said. "My mama and papa would go di<i>struc</i>ted if
anything happened to me."</p>
<p>"Something will happen, <i>sure,</i>" declared the turtle; "but nothing that happens will hurt
you in the least if you do exactly as I tell you."</p>
<p>"I won't have to fight that Carbolated Giant, will I?" Twinkle asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>"He isn't carbolated; he's corrugated. No, you won't have to fight at all. When the proper time
comes I'll do the fighting myself. But you may have to come with me to the Black Mountains, in
order to set me free."</p>
<p>"Is it far?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes; but it won't take us long to go there," answered the turtle. "Now, I'll tell you what to do
and, if you follow my advice no one will ever know you're been mixed up with fairies and strange
adventures."</p>
<p>"And Collerated Giants," she added.</p>
<p>"Corrugated," he corrected. "It is too late, this Saturday, to start upon our journey, so we must
wait another week. But next Saturday morning do you come to me bright and early, as soon as
you've had breakfast, and then I'll tell you what to do."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/221.jpg" alt="The turtle explains his plans"><br>THE TURTLE
EXPLAINS HIS PLANS</p>
<p>"All right," said Twinkle; "I won't forget."</p>
<p>"In the mean time, do give me a little clean water now and then. I'm a mud-turtle, sure enough;
but I'm also a fairy prince, and I must say I prefer clean water."</p>
<p>"I'll attend to it," promised the girl.</p>
<p>"Now put me down and run away," continued the turtle. "It will take me all the week to think
over my plans, and decide exactly what we are to do."</p>

<h2>Prince Turtle Remembers His Magic</h2>
<p><font size="+4">T</font><font size="+2">WINKLE</font> was as nervous as she could be
during all the week that followed this strange conversation with Prince Turtle. Every day, as soon as
school was out, she would run to the tub to see if the turtle was still safe&mdash;for she worried
lest it should run away or disappear in some strange manner. And during school hours it was such
hard work to keep her mind on her lessons that teacher scolded her more than once.</p>
<p>The fairy imprisoned in the turtle's form had nothing to say to her during this week, because he
would not be allowed to talk again until Saturday; so the most that Twinkle could do to show her
interest in the Prince was to give him the choicest food she could get and supply him with plenty of
fresh, clean water.</p>
<p>At last the day of her adventure arrived, and as soon as she could get away from the breakfast
table Twinkle ran out to the tub. There was her fairy turtle, safe as could be, and as she leaned over
the tub he put out his head and called "Good morning!" in his small, shrill voice.</p>
<p>"Good morning," she replied.</p>
<p>"Are you still willing and ready to assist me?" asked the turtle.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/225.jpg" alt="The trip through the air"><br>THE TRIP
THROUGH THE AIR/p>
<p>"To be sure," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Then take me in your hand," said he.</p>
<p>So she picked him out of the tub and placed him upon her hand. And the turtle said:</p>
<p>"Now pay strict attention, and do exactly as I tell you, and all will be well. In the first place, we
want to get to the Black Mountains; so you must repeat after me these words: '<i>Uller; aller; iller;
oller!</i>'"</p>
<p>"Uller; aller; iller; oller!" said Twinkle.</p>
<p>The next minute it seemed as though a gale of wind had struck her. It blew so strongly against
her eyes that she could not see; so she covered her face with one arm while with the other hand she
held fast to the turtle. Her skirts fluttered so wildly that it seemed as if they would tear themselves
from her body, and her sun-bonnet, not being properly fastened, was gone in a minute.</p>
<p>But it didn't last long, fortunately. After a few moments the wind stopped, and she found she
could breathe again. Then she looked around her and drew another long breath, for instead of being
in the back yard at home she stood on the side of a beautiful mountain, and spread before her were
the loveliest green valleys she had ever beheld.</p>
<p>"Well, we're here," said the turtle, in a voice that sounded as if he were well pleased. "I thought
I hadn't forgotten my fairy wisdom."</p>
<p>"Where are we?" asked the child.</p>
<p>"In the Black Mountains, of course," was the reply. "We've come a good way, but it didn't take
us long to arrive, did it?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed," she answered, still gazing down the mountain side at the flower-strewn grass-land
of the valleys.</p>
<p>"This," said the turtle, sticking his little head out of the shell as far as it would go, "is the realm
of the fairies, where I used to dwell. Those beautiful palaces you see yonder are inhabited by
Queen Flutterlight and my people, and that grim castle at your left, standing on the side of the
mountain, is where the Corrugated Giant lives."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/229.jpg" alt="&quot;Rub your eyelids with
it&quot;"><br>"RUB YOUR EYELIDS WITH IT"</p>
<p>"I don't see anything!" exclaimed Twinkle; "that is, nothing but the valleys and the flowers and
grass."</p>
<p>"True; I had forgotten that these things are invisible to your mortal eyes. But it is necessary that
you should see all clearly, if you are going to rescue me from this terrible form and restore me to
my natural shape. Now, put me down upon the ground, for I must search for a particular plant
whose leaf has a magic virtue."</p>
<p>So Twinkle put him down, and the little turtle began running around here and there, looking
carefully at the different plants that grew amongst the grass on the mountain side. But his legs were
so short and his shell-covered body so heavy, that he couldn't move very fast; so presently he
called for her to pick him up again, and hold him close to the ground while she walked among the
plants. She did this, and after what seemed a long search the turtle suddenly cried out:</p>
<p>"Stop! Here it is! This is the plant I want."</p>
<p>"Which&mdash;this?" asked the girl, touching a broad green leaf.</p>
<p>"Yes. Pluck the leaf from the stem and rub your eyelids with it."</p>
<p>She obeyed, and having rubbed her lids well with the leaf, she again opened her eyes and
beheld the real Fairyland.</p>

<hr width="10%">
<h2>Twinkle Promises to Be Brave</h2>
<p><font size="+4">I</font><font size="+2">N</font> the center of the valley was a great cluster
of palaces that appeared to be built of crystal and silver and mother-of-pearl, and golden filigree-
work. So dainty and beautiful were these fairy dwellings that Twinkle had no doubt for an instant
but that she gazed upon fairyland. She could almost see, from the far mountain upon which she
stood, the airy, gauze-winged forms of the fairies themselves, floating gently amidst their pretty
palaces and moving gracefully along the jeweled streets.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/233.jpg" alt="&quot;That fence is
enchanted&quot;"><br>"THAT FENCE IS ENCHANTED"</p>
<p>But another sight now attracted her attention&mdash;a big, gray, ugly looking castle standing
frowning on the mountain side at her left. It overlooked the lovely city of palaces like a dark cloud
on the edge of a blue sky, and the girl could not help giving a shudder as she saw it. All around the
castle was a high fence of iron spikes.</p>
<p>"That fence is enchanted," said the turtle, as if he knew she was looking at it; "and no fairy can
pass it, because the power to prevent it has been given to the giant. But a mortal has never been
forbidden to pass the fence, for no one ever supposed that a mortal would come here or be able to
see it. That is the reason I have brought you to this place, and the reason why you alone are able to
help me."</p>
<p>"Gracious!" cried Twinkle; "must I meet the Carbonated Giant?"</p>
<p>"He's corrugated," said the turtle.</p>
<p>"I know he's something dreadful," she wailed, "because he's so hard to pronounce."</p>
<p>"You will surely have to meet him," declared the turtle; "but do not fear, I will protect you from
all harm."</p>
<p>"Well, a Corralated Giant's a mighty big person," said the girl, doubtfully, "and a mud-turtle isn't
much of a fighter. I guess I'll go home."</p>
<p>"That is impossible," declared the turtle. "You are too far from home ever to get back without
my help, so you may as well be good and obedient."</p>
<p>"What must I do?" she asked.</p>
<p>"We will wait until it is nearly noon, when the giant will put his pot on the fire to boil his dinner.
We can tell the right time by watching the smoke come out of his chimney. Then you must march
straight up to the castle and into the kitchen where the giant is at work, and throw me quickly into
the boiling kettle. That is all that you will be required to do."</p>
<p>"I never could do it!" declared Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"You'd be scalded to death, and then I'd be a murderer!"</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/237.jpg" alt="Hunting the magic flower"><br>HUNTING THE
MAGIC FLOWER</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" said the turtle, peevishly. "I know what I'm doing, and if you obey me I'll not be
scalded but an instant; for then I'll resume my own form. Remember that I'm a fairy, and fairies
can't be killed so easily as you seem to think."</p>
<p>"Won't it hurt you?" she inquired.</p>
<p>"Only for a moment; but the reward will be so great that I won't mind an instant's pain. Will you
do this favor for me?"</p>
<p>"I'll try," replied Twinkle, gravely.</p>
<p>"Then I will be very grateful," said Prince Turtle, "and agree to afterward send you home safe
and sound, and as quickly as you came."</p>

<h2>Twinkle Meets the Corrugated Giants</h2>
<p><font size="+4">"A</font><font size="+2">ND</font> now, while we are waiting," continued
the fairy turtle, "I want to find a certain flower that has wonderful powers to protect mortals from
any injury. Not that I fear I shall be unable to take care of you, but it's just as well to be on the safe
side."</p>
<p>"Better," said Twinkle, earnestly. "Where's the flower?"</p>
<p>"We'll hunt for it," replied the turtle.</p>
<p>So holding him in her hand in such a way that he could see all the flowers that grew, the girl
began wandering over the mountain side, and everything was so beautiful around her that she
would have been quite contented and happy had not the gray castle been before her to remind her
constantly that she must face the terrible giant who lived within it.</p>
<p>They found the flower at last&mdash;a pretty pink blossom that looked like a double daisy, but
must have been something else, because a daisy has no magic power that I ever heard of. And
when it was found, the turtle told her to pick the flower and pin it fast to the front of her dress;
which she did.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/241.jpg" alt="Twinkle manages to squeeze
through"><br>TWINKLE MANAGES TO SQUEEZE THROUGH</p>
<p>By that time the smoke began to roll out of the giant's chimney in big black clouds; so the fairy
turtle said the giant must be getting dinner, and the pot would surely be boiling by the time they got
to the castle.</p>
<p>Twinkle couldn't help being a little afraid to approach the giant's stronghold, but she tried to be
brave, and so stepped along briskly until she came to the fence of iron spikes.</p>
<p>"You must squeeze through between two of the spikes," said the turtle.</p>
<p>She didn't think it could possibly be done; but to her surprise it was quite easy, and she
managed to squeeze through the fence without even tearing her dress. Then she walked up a great
driveway, which was lined with white skulls of many sheep which the giant had eaten, to the front
door of the castle, which stood ajar.</p>
<p>"Go in," said the turtle; so she boldly entered and passed down a high arched hall toward a
room in the rear.</p>
<p>"This is the kitchen," said the turtle, "Enter quickly, go straight to the kettle, and throw me into
the boiling water."</p>
<p>Twinkle entered quickly enough, but then she stopped short with a cry of amazement; for there
before her stood the ugly giant, blowing the fire with an immense pair of bellows.</p>

<h2>Prince Mud-Turtle Becomes Prince Melga</h2>
<p><font size="+4">T</font><font size="+2">HE</font> giant was as big around as ten men, and
as tall as two; but, having no bones, he seemed pushed together, so that his skin wrinkled up like
the sides of an accordeon, or a photograph camera, even his face being so wrinkled that his nose
stuck out between two folds of flesh and his eyes from between two more. In one end of the
kitchen was the great fireplace, above which hung an iron kettle with a big iron spoon in it. And at
the other end was a table set for dinner.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/245.jpg" alt="Twinkle meets the Corrugated
Giant"><br>TWINKLE MEETS THE CORRUGATED GIANT</p>
<p>As the giant was standing between the kettle and Twinkle, she could not do as the turtle had
commanded, and throw him into the pot. So she hesitated, wondering how to obey the fairy. Just
then the giant happened to turn around and see her.</p>
<p>"By the whiskers of Gammarog&mdash;who was one of my ancestors that was killed by Jack
the Giant-Killer!" he cried, but in a very mild voice for so big a person. "Whom have we here?"</p>
<p>"I'm Twinkle," said the girl, drawing a long breath.</p>
<p>"Then, to pay you for your folly in entering my castle, I will make you my slave, and some
day, if you're not good, I'll feed you to my seventeen-headed dog. I never eat little girls myself. I
prefer mutton."</p>
<p>Twinkle's heart almost stopped beating when she heard these awful words. All she could do
was to stand still and look imploringly at the giant. But she held the fairy mud-turtle clasped tight in
her hand, so that the monster couldn't see it.</p>
<p>"Well, what are you staring at?" shouted the Corrugated Giant, angrily. "Blow up that fire this
instant, slave!"</p>
<p>He stood aside for her to pass, and Twinkle ran at once to the fireplace. The pot was now
before her, and within easy reach, and it was bubbling hot.</p>
<p>In an instant she reached out her hand and tossed the turtle into the boiling water; and then, with
a cry of horror at her own action, she drew back to see what would happen.</p>
<p>The turtle was a fairy, all right; and he had known very well the best way to break the
enchantment his enemy had put upon him. For no sooner had Twinkle tossed him into the boiling
pot than a great hissing was heard, and a cloud of steam hid for an instant the fireplace. Then, as it
cleared away, a handsome young prince stepped forward, fully armed; for the turtle was again a
fairy, and the kettle had changed into a strong shield which he bore upon his left arm, and the iron
spoon was now a long and glittering sword.</p>

<p><font size="+4">T</font><font size="+2">HE</font> giant gave a roar like that of a baby bull
when he saw Prince Melga standing before him, and in a twinkling he had caught up a big club that
stood near and began whirling it over his head. But before it could descend, the prince ran at him
and stuck his sword as far as it would go into the corrugated body of the giant. Again the monster
roared and tried to fight; but the sword had hurt him badly, and the prince pushed it into the evil
creature again and again, until the end came, and his corrugated enemy rolled over upon the floor
quite dead.</p>
<p>Then the fairy turned to Twinkle, and kneeling before her he kissed her hand.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much," he said, in a sweet voice, "for setting me free. You are a very brave
little girl!"</p>
<p>"I'm not so sure about that," she answered. "I was dreadfully scared!"</p>
<p>Now he took her hand and led her from the castle; and she didn't have to squeeze through the
fence again, because the fairy had only to utter a magic word and the gate flew open. And when
they turned to look back, the castle of the Corrugated Giant, with all that it had contained, had
vanished from sight, never to be seen again by either mortal or fairy eyes. For that was sure to
happen whenever the giant was dead.</p>
<p>The prince led Twinkle into the valley where the fairy palaces stood, and told all his people,
when they crowded around to welcome him, how kind the little girl had been to him, and how her
courage had enabled him to defeat the giant and to regain his proper form. And all the fairies
praised Twinkle with kind words, and the lovely Queen Flutterlight, who seemed altogether too
young to be the mother of the handsome prince, gave to the child a golden medal with a tiny mud-
turtle engraved upon one side of it.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/253.jpg" alt="&quot;Don't forget me,
Twinkle&quot;"><br>"DON'T FORGET ME, TWINKLE"</p>
<p>Then, after a fine feast had been prepared, and the little girl had eaten all she could of the fairy
sweetmeats, she told Prince Melga she would like to go home again.</p>
<p>"Very well," said he. "Don't forget me, Twinkle, although we probably shall never meet again.
I'll send you home quite as safely as you came; but as your eyes have been rubbed with the magic
maita-leaf, you will doubtless always see many strange sights that are hidden from other
mortals."</p>
<p>"I don't mind," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>Then she bade good-bye to the fairies, and the prince spoke a magic word. There was another
rush of wind, and when it had passed Twinkle found herself once more in the back yard at
home.</p>
<p>As she sat upon the grass rubbing her eyes and wondering at the strange adventure that had
befallen her, mamma came out upon the back porch and said:</p>
<p>"Your turtle has crawled out of the tub and run away."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Twinkle, "I know; and I'm glad of it!"</p>
<p>But she kept her secret to herself.</p>

<h2>Twinkle Enters the Big Gulch</h2>
<p><font size="+4">O</font><font size="+2">NE</font> afternoon Twinkle decided to go into the
big gulch and pick some blueberries for papa's supper. She had on her blue gingham dress and her
blue sun-bonnet, and there were stout shoes upon her feet. So she took her tin pail and started
out.</p>
<p>"Be back in time for supper," called mamma from the kitchen porch.</p>
<p>"'Course," said Twinkle, as she trotted away. "I'm not hungry now, but I'll be hungry 'nough
when supper-time comes. 'Course I'll be back!"</p>
<p>The side of the gulch was but a little way from the house. It was like a big ditch, only the sides
were not too steep to crawl down; and in the middle of the gulch were rolling hills and deep gullies,
all covered with wild bushes and vines and a few flowering plants&mdash;very rare in this part of
the country.</p>
<p>Twinkle hadn't lived very long in this section of Dakota, for her father had just bought the new
farm that lay beside the gulch. So the big ditch was a great delight to her, and she loved to wander
through it and pick the berries and flowers that never grew on the plains above.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/263.jpg" alt="Twinkle Goes into the Gulch"><br>TWINKLE
GOES INTO THE GULCH</p>
<p>To-day she crept carefully down the path back of the house and soon reached the bottom of the
gulch. Then she began to search for the berries; but all were gone in the places where she had
picked them before; so she found she must go further along.</p>

<p>She sat down to rest for a time, and by and by she happened to look up at the other side and
saw a big cluster of bushes hanging full of ripe blueberries&mdash;just about half way up the
opposite bank.</p>
<p>She had never gone so far before, but if she wanted the berries for papa's supper she knew she
must climb up the slope and get them; so she rose to her feet and began to walk in that direction. It
was all new to the little girl, and seemed to her like a beautiful fairyland; but she had no idea that
the gulch was enchanted. Soon a beetle crawled across her path, and as she stopped to let it go by,
she heard it say:</p>
<p>"Look out for the line of enchantment! You'll soon cross it, if you don't watch out."</p>
<p>"What line of enchantment?" asked Twinkle.</p>
<p>"It's almost under your nose," replied the little creature.</p>
<p>"I don't see anything at all," she said, after looking closely.</p>
<p>"Of course you don't," said the beetle. "It isn't a mark, you know, that any one can see with
their eyes; but it's a line of enchantment, just the same, and whoever steps over it is sure to see
strange things and have strange adventures."</p>
<p>"I don't mind that," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't mind if you don't," returned the beetle, and by that time he had crept across the
path and disappeared underneath a big rock.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/267.jpg" alt="Twinkle Meets the Beetle"><br>TWINKLE
MEETS THE BEETLE</p>
<p>Twinkle went on, without being at all afraid. If the beetle spoke truly, and there really was an
invisible line that divided the common, real world from an enchanted country, she was very eager
to cross it, as any little girl might well be. And then it occurred to her that she must have crossed the
enchanted line before she met the beetle, for otherwise she wouldn't have understood his language,
or known what he was talking about. Children don't talk with beetles in the real world, as Twinkle
knew very well, and she was walking along soberly, thinking this over, when suddenly a voice
cried out to her:</p>
<p>"Be careful!"</p>

<h2>The Rolling Stone</h2>
<p><font size="+4">O</font><font size="+2">F</font> course Twinkle stopped then, and looked
around to see who had spoken. But no one was anywhere in sight. So she started on again.</p>
<p>"Look out, or you'll step on me!" cried the voice a second time.</p>
<p>She looked at her feet very carefully. There was nothing near them but a big round stone that
was about the size of her head, and a prickly thistle that she never would step on if she could
possibly help it.</p>
<p>"Who's talking?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Why, <i>I'm</i> talking," answered the voice. "Who do you suppose it is?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Twinkle. "I just can't see anybody at all."</p>
<p>"Then you must be blind," said the voice. "I'm the Rolling Stone, and I'm about two inches from
your left toes."</p>
<p>"The Rolling Stone!"</p>
<p>"That's it. That's me. I'm the Rolling Stone that gathers no moss."</p>
<p>"You can't be," said Twinkle, sitting down in the path and looking carefully at the stone.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because you don't roll," she said. "You're a stone, of course; I can see that, all right. But you're
not rolling."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/271.jpg" alt="Twinkle looks carefully at the
stone"><br>TWINKLE LOOKS CAREFULLY AT THE STONE</p>
<p>How silly!" replied the Stone. "I don't have to roll every minute to be a Rolling Stone, do
I?"</p>
<p>"Of course you do," answered Twinkle. "If you don't roll you're just a common, <i>still</i>
stone."</p>
<p>"Well, I declare!" exclaimed the Stone; "you don't seem to understand anything. You're a
Talking Girl, are you not?"</p>
<p>"To be sure I am," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>"But you don't talk every minute, do you?"</p>
<p>"Mama says I do," she answered.</p>
<p>"But you don't. You're sometimes quiet, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"'Course I am."</p>
<p>"That's the way with me. Sometimes I roll, and so I'm called the Rolling Stone. Sometimes you
talk, and so you're the Talking Girl."</p>
<p>"No; I'm Twinkle," she said.</p>
<p>"That doesn't sound like a name," remarked the Stone.</p>
<p>"It's what papa calls me, anyway," explained the girl. Then, thinking she had lingered long
enough, she added:</p>
<p>"I'm going up the hill to pick those berries. Since you can roll, suppose you go with me."</p>
<p>"What! Up hill?" exclaimed the Stone.</p>
<p>"Why not?" asked Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Who ever heard of a stone rolling up hill? It's unnatural!"</p>
<p>"Any stone can roll down hill," said the child. "If you can't roll up hill, you're no better than a
common cobble-stone."</p>
<p>"Oh, I can roll up hill if I have to," declared the Stone, peevishly. "But it's hard work, and
nearly breaks my back."</p>
<p>"I can't see that you have any back," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Why, I'm all back," replied the Stone. "When <i>your</i> back aches, it's only a part of you.
But when <i>my</i> back aches, it's all of me except the middle."</p>
<p>"The middle ache is the worst of all," said Twinkle, solemnly. "Well, if you don't want to go,"
she added, jumping up, "I'll say good-bye."</p>
<p>"Anything to be sociable," said the Stone, sighing deeply. "I'll go along and keep you company.
But it's lots easier to roll down than it is to roll up, I assure you!"</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/275.jpg" alt="&quot;Wait a minute&quot;"><br>"WAIT A
MINUTE"</p>
<p>"Why, you're a reg'lar grumbler!" exclaimed Twinkle.</p>
<p>"That's because I lead a hard life," returned the Stone, dismally. "But don't let us quarrel; it is so
seldom I get a chance to talk with one of my own standing in society."</p>
<p>"You can't have any standing, without feet," declared Twinkle, shaking her head at the
Stone.</p>
<p>"One can have <i>under</i>standing, at least," was the answer; "and understanding is the best
standing any person can have."</p>
<p>"Perhaps that is true," said the child, thoughtfully; "but I'm glad I have legs, just the same."</p>

<h2>Some Queer Acquaintances</h2>
<p><font size="+4">"W</font><font size="+2">AIT</font> a minute!" implored a small voice, and
the girl noticed a yellow butterfly that had just settled down upon the stone. "Aren't you the child
from the farm?"</p>
<p>"To be sure," she answered, much amused to hear the butterfly speak.</p>
<p>"Then can you tell me if your mother expects to churn to-day," said the pretty creature, slowly
folding and unfolding its dainty wings.</p>
<p>"Why do you want to know?"</p>
<p>"If she churns to-day, I'll fly over to the house and try to steal some butter. But if your mother
isn't going to churn, I'll fly down into the gulch and rob a bees' nest I know of."</p>
<p>"Why do you rob and steal?" inquired Twinkle.</p>
<p>"It's the only way I can get my living," said the butterfly. "Nobody ever gives me anything, and
so I have to take what I want."</p>
<p>"Do you like butter?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do! That's why we are called butterflies, you know. I prefer butter to anything else,
and I have heard that in some countries the children always leave a little dish of butter on the
window-sill, so that we may help ourselves whenever we are hungry. I wish I had been born in
such a country."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/279.jpg" alt="The Little Learning"><br>THE LITTLE
LEARNING</p>
<p>"Mother won't churn until Saturday," said Twinkle. "I know, 'cause I've got to help her, and I
just hate butter-making!"</p>
<p>"Then I won't go to the farm to-day," replied the butterfly. "Good-bye, little girl. If you think of
it, leave a dish of butter around where I can get at it."</p>
<p>"All right," said Twinkle, and the butterfly waved its wings and fluttered through the air into the
gulch below.</p>
<p>Then the girl started up the hill and the Stone rolled slowly beside her, groaning and grumbling
because the ground was so rough.</p>
<p>Presently she noticed running across the path a tiny Book, not much bigger than a postage-
stamp. It had two slender legs, like those of a bumble-bee, and upon these it ran so fast that all the
leaves fluttered wildly, the covers being half open.</p>
<p>"What's that?" asked Twinkle, looking after the book in surprise.</p>
<p>"That is a little Learning," answered the Stone. "Look out for it, for they say it's a dangerous
thing."</p>
<p>"It's gone already," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Let it go. Nobody wants it, that I know of. Just help me over this bump, will you?"</p>
<p>So she rolled the Stone over the little hillock, and just as she did so her attention was attracted
by a curious noise that sounded like "Pop! pop! pop!"</p>
<p>"What's that?" she inquired, hesitating to advance.</p>
<p>"Only a weasel," answered the Stone. "Stand still a minute, and you'll see him. Whenever he
thinks he's alone, and there's no one to hear, 'pop' goes the weasel."</p>
<p>Sure enough, a little animal soon crossed their path, making the funny noise at every step. But
as soon as he saw that Twinkle was staring at him he stopped popping and rushed into a bunch of
tall grass and hid himself.</p>
<p>And now they were almost at the berry-bushes, and Twinkle trotted so fast that the Rolling
Stone had hard work to keep up with her. But when she got to the bushes she found a flock of
strange birds sitting upon them and eating up the berries as fast as they could. The birds were not
much bigger than robins, and were covered with a soft, velvety skin instead of with feathers, and
they had merry black eyes and long, slender beaks curving downward from their noses, which gave
to their faces a saucy expression. The lack of usual feathers might not have surprised Twinkle so
much had she not noticed upon the tail of each bird one single, solitary feather of great length,
which was certainly a remarkable thing.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/283.jpg" alt="The birds of one feather"><br>THE BIRDS OF
ONE FEATHER</p>
<p>"I know what they are," she said, nodding her head wisely; "they're birds of a feather."</p>
<p>At this the birds burst into a chorus of laughter, and one of them said:</p>
<p>"Perhaps you think that's why we flock together."</p>
<p>"Well, isn't that the reason?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Not a bit of it," declared the bird. "The reason we flock together is because we're too proud to
mix with common birds, who have feathers all over them."</p>
<p>"I should think you'd be ashamed, 'cause you're so naked," she returned.</p>
<p>"The fact is, Twinkle," said another bird, as he pecked at a blueberry and swallowed it, "the
common things in this world don't amount to much. There are millions of birds on earth, but only a
few of us that have but one feather. In my opinion, if you had but one hair upon your head you'd
be much prettier."</p>
<p>"I'd be more 'strord'nary, I'm sure," said Twinkle, using the biggest word she could think of.</p>
<p>"There's no accounting for tastes," remarked the Rolling Stone, which had just arrived at
Twinkle's side after a hard roll up the path. "For my part, I haven't either hair or feathers, and I'm
glad of it."</p>
<p>The birds laughed again, at this, and as they had eaten all the berries they cared for, they now
flew into the air and disappeared.</p>

<h2>The Dancing Bear</h2>
<p><font size="+4">"R</font><font size="+2">EALLY,"</font> said Twinkle, as she began picking
the berries and putting them into her pail, "I didn't know so many things could talk."</p>
<p>"It's because you are in the part of the gulch that's enchanted," answered the Rolling Stone.
"When you get home again, you'll think this is all a dream."</p>
<p>"I wonder if it isn't!" she suddenly cried, stopping to look around, and then feeling of herself
carefully. "It's usually the way in all the fairy stories that papa reads to me. I don't remember going
to sleep any time; but perhaps I did, after all."</p>
<p>"Don't let it worry you," said the Stone, making a queer noise that Twinkle thought was meant
for a laugh. "If you wake up, you'll be sorry you didn't dream longer; and if you find you haven't
been asleep, this will be a wonderful adventure."</p>
<p>"That's true enough," the girl answered, and again began filling her pail with the berries. "When
I tell mama all this, she won't believe a word of it. And papa will laugh and pinch my cheek, and
say I'm like Alice in Wonderland, or Dorothy in the Land of Oz."</p>
<p>Just then she noticed something big and black coming around the bushes from the other side,
and her heart beat a good deal faster when she saw before her a great bear standing upon his rear
legs beside her.</p>
<p>He had a little red cap on his head that was kept in place by a band of rubber elastic. His eyes
were small, but round and sparkling, and there seemed to be a smile upon his face, for his white
teeth showed in two long rows.</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid," called out the Rolling Stone; "it's only the Dancing Bear."</p>
<p>"Why should the child be afraid?" asked the bear, speaking in a low, soft tone that reminded
her of the purring of a kitten. "No one ever heard of a Dancing Bear hurting anybody. We're about
the most harmless things in the world."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/291.jpg" alt="Twinkle and the bear continue their
walk"><br>TWINKLE AND THE BEAR CONTINUE THEIR WALK</p>
<p>"Are you really a Dancing Bear?" asked Twinkle, curiously.</p>
<p>"I am, my dear," he replied, bowing low and then folding his arms proudly as he leaned against
a big rock that was near. "I wish there was some one here who could tell you what a fine dancer I
am. It wouldn't be modest for me to praise myself, you know." </p>"<p>I s'pose not," said Twinkle.
"But if you're a Dancing Bear, why don't you dance?"</p>
<p>"There it is again!" cried the Rolling Stone. "This girl Twinkle wants to keep every body
moving. She wouldn't believe, at first, that I was a Rolling Stone, because I was lying quiet just
then. And now she won't believe you're a Dancing Bear, because you don't eternally keep
dancing."</p>
<p>"Well, there's some sense in that, after all," declared the Bear. "I'm only a Dancing Bear while
I'm dancing, to speak the exact truth; and you're only a Rolling Stone while you're rolling."</p>
<p>"I beg to disagree with you," returned the Stone, in a cold voice.</p>
<p>"Well, don't let us quarrel, on any account," said the Bear. "I invite you both to come to my
cave and see me dance. Then Twinkle will be sure I'm a Dancing Bear."</p>
<p>"I haven't filled my pail yet," said the little girl, "and I've got to get enough berries for papa's
supper."</p>
<p>"I'll help you," replied the Bear, politely; and at once he began to pick berries and to put them
into Twinkle's pail. His big paws looked very clumsy and awkward, but it was astonishing how
many blueberries the bear could pick with them. Twinkle had hard work to keep up with him, and
almost before she realized how fast they had worked, the little pail was full and overflowing with
fine, plump berries.</p>
<p>"And now," said the Bear, "I will show you the way to my cave."</p>
<p>He took her hand in his soft paw and began leading her along the side of the steep hill, while
the Stone rolled busily along just behind them. But they had not gone far before Twinkle's foot
slipped, and in trying to save herself from falling she pushed hard against the Stone and tumbled it
from the pathway.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/295.jpg" alt="The fall of the Rolling Stone"><br>THE FALL
OF THE ROLLING STONE</p>
<p>"Now you've done it!" growled the Stone, excitedly, as it whirled around. "Here I go, for I've
lost my balance and I can't help myself!"</p>
<p>Even as he spoke the big round stone was flying down the side of the gulch, bumping against
the hillocks and bits of rock&mdash;sometimes leaping into the air and then clinging close to the
ground, but going faster and faster every minute.</p>
<p>"Dear me," said Twinkle, looking after it; "I'm afraid the Rolling Stone will get hurt."</p>
<p>"No danger of that," replied the Bear. "It's as hard as a rock, and not a thing in the gulch could
hurt it a bit. But our friend would have to roll a long time to get back here again, so we won't wait.
Come along, my dear."</p>
<p>He held out his paw again, and Twinkle took it with one of her hands while she carried the pail
with the other, and so managed to get over the rough ground very easily.</p>

<h2>The Cave of the Waterfall</h2>
<p><font size="+4">B</font><font size="+2">EFORE</font> long they came to the entrance to the
cave, and as it looked dark and gloomy from without Twinkle drew back and said she guessed she
wouldn't go in.</p>
<p>"But it's quite light inside," said the bear, "and there's a pretty waterfall there, too. Don't be
afraid, Twinkle; I'll take good care of you."</p>
<p>So the girl plucked up courage and permitted him to lead her into the cave; and then she was
glad she had come, instead of being a 'fraid-cat. For the place was big and roomy, and there were
many cracks in the roof, that admitted plenty of light and air. Around the side walls were several
pairs of big ears, which seemed to have been carved out of the rock. These astonished the little
girl.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/299.jpg" alt="The Dancing Bear displays his talents"><br>THE
DANCING BEAR DISPLAYS HIS TALENTS</p>
<p>"What are the ears for?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Don't walls have ears where you live?" returned the Bear, as if surprised.</p>
<p>"I've heard they do," she answered, "but I've never seen any before."</p>
<p>At the back of the cave was a little, tinkling waterfall, that splashed into a pool beneath with a
sound that was very like music. Near this was a square slab of rock, a little raised above the level of
the floor.</p>
<p>"Kindly take a seat, my dear," said the bear, "and I'll try to amuse you, and at the same time
prove that I can dance."</p>
<p>So to the music of the waterfall the bear began dancing. He climbed upon the flat stone, made a
graceful bow to Twinkle, and then balanced himself first upon one foot and then upon the other,
and swung slowly around in a circle, and then back again.</p>
<p>"How do you like it?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I don't care much for it," said Twinkle. "I believe I could do better myself."</p>
<p>"But you are not a bear," he answered. "Girls ought to dance better than bears, you know. But
not every bear can dance. If I had a hand-organ to make the music, instead of this waterfall, I might
do better."</p>
<p>"Then I wish you had one," said the girl.</p>
<p>The Bear began dancing again, and this time he moved more rapidly and shuffled his feet in
quite a funny manner. He almost fell off the slab once or twice, so anxious was he to prove he
could dance. And once he tripped over his own foot, which made Twinkle laugh.</p>
<p>Just as he was finishing his dance a strange voice cried out:</p>
<p>"For bear!" and a green monkey sprang into the cave and threw a big rock at the performer. It
knocked the bear off the slab, and he fell into the pool of water at the foot of the waterfall, and
was dripping wet when he scrambled out again.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/303.jpg" alt="The green monkey makes mischief"><br>THE
GREEN MONKEY MAKES MISCHIEF</p>
<p>The Dancing Bear gave a big growl and ran as fast as he could after the monkey, finally chasing
him out of the cave. Twinkle picked up her pail of berries and followed, and when she got into the
sunshine again on the side of the hill she saw the monkey and the bear hugging each other tight,
and growling and chattering in a way that showed they were angry with each other and not on
pleasant terms.</p>
<p>"You <i>will</i> throw rocks at me, will you?" shouted the Bear.</p>
<p>"I will if I get the chance," replied the monkey. "Wasn't that a fine, straight shot? and didn't you
go plump into the water, though?" and he shrieked with laughter.</p>
<p>Just then they fell over in a heap, and began rolling down the hill.</p>
<p>"Let go!" yelled the Bear.</p>
<p>"Let go, yourself!" screamed the monkey.</p>
<p>But neither of them did let go, so they rolled faster and faster down the hill, and the last that
Twinkle saw of them they were bounding among the bushes at the very bottom of the big
gulch.</p>

around her; "I'm as good as lost in this strange place, and I don't know in what direction to go to get
home again."</p>
<p>So she sat down on the grass and tried to think which way she had come, and which way she
ought to return in order to get across the gulch to the farm-house.</p>
<p>"If the Rolling Stone was here, he might tell me," she said aloud. "But I'm all alone."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/307.jpg" alt="Twinkle meets Prince Nimble"><br>TWINKLE
MEETS PRINCE NIMBLE</p>
<p>"Oh, no, you're not," piped a small, sweet voice. "I'm here, and I know much more than the
Rolling Stone does."</p>
<p>Twinkle looked this way and then that, very carefully, in order to see who had spoken, and at
last she discovered a pretty grasshopper perched upon a long blade of grass nearby.</p>
<p>"Did I hear you speak?" she inquired.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the grasshopper. "I'm Prince Nimble, the hoppiest hopper in Hoptown."</p>
<p>"Where is that?" asked the child.</p>
<p>"Why, Hoptown is near the bottom of the gulch, in that thick patch of grass you see yonder. It's
on your way home, so I'd be pleased to have you visit it."</p>
<p>"Won't I step on some of you?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Not if you are careful," replied Prince Nimble. "Grasshoppers don't often get stepped on.
We're pretty active, you know."</p>
<p>"All right," said Twinkle. "I'd like to see a grasshopper village."</p>
<p>"Then follow me, and I'll guide you," said Nimble, and at once he leaped from the blade of
grass and landed at least six feet away.</p>
<p>Twinkle got up and followed, keeping her eye on the pretty Prince, who leaped so fast that she
had to trot to keep up with him. Nimble would wait on some clump of grass or bit of rock until the
girl came up, and then away he'd go again.</p>
<p>"How far is it?" Twinkle once asked him.</p>
<p>"About a mile and a half," was the answer; "we'll soon be there, for you are as good as a mile,
and I'm good for the half-mile."</p>
<p>"How do you figure that out?" asked Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Why, I've always heard that a miss is as good as a mile, and you're a miss, are you not?"</p>
<p>"Not yet," she answered; "I'm only a little girl. But papa will be sure to miss me if I don't get
home to supper."</p>

<h2>The Grasshoppers' Hop</h2>
<p><font size="+4">T</font><font size="+2">WINKLE</font> now began to fear she wouldn't get
home to supper, for the sun started to sink into the big prairie, and in the golden glow it left behind,
the girl beheld most beautiful palaces and castles suspended in the air just above the hollow in
which she stood. Splendid banners floated from the peaks and spires of these magnificent
buildings, and all the windows seemed of silver and all the roofs of gold.</p>
<p>"What city is that?" she asked, standing still, in amazement.</p>
<p>"That isn't any city," replied the grasshopper. "They are only Castles in the Air&mdash;very
pretty to look at, but out of everybody's reach. Come along, my little friend; we're almost at
Hoptown."</p>
<p>So Twinkle walked on, and before long Prince Nimble paused on the stem of a hollyhock and
said:</p>
<p>"Now, sit down carefully, right where you are, and you will be able to watch my people. It is
the night of our regular hop&mdash;if you listen you can hear the orchestra tuning up."</p>
<p>She sat down, as he bade her, and tried to listen, but only heard a low whirr and rattle like the
noise of a beetle's wings.</p>
<p>"That's the drummer," said Prince Nimble. "He is very clever, indeed."</p>
<p>"Good gracious! It's night," said Twinkle, with a start. "I ought to be at home and in bed this
very minute!"</p>
<p>"Never mind," said the grasshopper; "you can sleep any time, but this is our annual ball, and it's
a great privilege to witness it."</p>
<p>Suddenly the grass all around them became brilliantly lighted, as if from a thousand tiny electric
lamps. Twinkle looked closely, and saw that a vast number of fireflies had formed a circle around
them, and were illuminating the scene of the ball.</p>
<p>In the center of the circle were assembled hundreds of grasshoppers, of all sizes. The small
ones were of a delicate green color, and the middle-sized ones of a deeper green, while the biggest
ones were a yellowish brown.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/315.jpg" alt="The bugs' orchestra"><br>THE BUGS'
ORCHESTRA</p>
<p>But the members of the orchestra interested Twinkle more than anything else. They were seated
upon the broad top of a big toadstool at one side, and the musicians were all beetles and big-bugs.
A fat water-beetle played a bass fiddle as big and fat as himself, and two pretty ladybugs played the
violins. A scarab, brightly colored with scarlet and black, tooted upon a long horn, and a sand-
beetle made the sound of a drum with its wings. Then there was a coleopto, making shrill sounds
like a flute&mdash;only of course Twinkle didn't know the names of these beetles, and thought
they were all just "bugs."</p>
<p>When the orchestra began to play, the music was more pleasing than you might suppose;
anyway, the grasshoppers liked it, for they commenced at once to dance.</p>
<p>The antics of the grasshoppers made Twinkle laugh more than once, for the way they danced
was to hop around in a circle, and jump over each other, and then a lady grasshopper and a
gentleman grasshopper would take hold of hands and stand on their long rear legs and swing
partners until it made the girl dizzy just to watch them.</p>
<p>Sometimes two of them would leap at once, and knock against each other in the air, and then go
tumbling to the ground, where the other dancers tripped over them. She saw Prince Nimble dancing
away with the others, and his partner was a lovely green grasshopper with sparkling black eyes and
wings that were like velvet. They didn't bump into as many of the others as some did, and Twinkle
thought they danced very gracefully indeed.</p>
<p>And now, while the merriment was at its height, and waiter-grasshoppers were passing around
refreshments that looked like grass seeds covered with thick molasses, a big cat suddenly jumped
into the circle.</p>
<p>At once all the lights went out, for the fire-flies fled in every direction; but in the darkness
Twinkle thought she could still hear the drone of the big bass fiddle and the flute-like trill of the
ladybugs.</p>

<p>The next thing Twinkle knew, some one was shaking her shoulder.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/320.jpg" alt="Acorns"></p>
<p>"Wake up, dear," said her mother's voice. "It's nearly supper-time, and papa's waiting for you.
And I see you haven't picked a single blueberry."</p>
<p>"Why, I picked 'em, all right," replied Twinkle, sitting up and first rubbing her eyes and then
looking gravely at her empty tin pail. "They were all in the pail a few minutes ago. I wonder
whatever became of them!"</p>

<h2>The Golden Key</h2>
<p><font size="+4">T</font><font size="+2">WINKLE</font> had come to visit her old friend
Chubbins, whose mother was now teaching school in a little town at the foot of the Ozark
Mountains, in Arkansas. Twinkle's own home was in Dakota, so the mountains that now towered
around her made her open her eyes in wonder.</p>
<p>Near by&mdash;so near, in fact, that she thought she might almost reach out her arm and touch
it&mdash;was Sugar-Loaf Mountain, round and high and big. And a little to the south was
Backbone Mountain, and still farther along a peak called Crystal Mountain.</p>
<p>The very next day after her arrival Twinkle asked Chubbins to take her to see the mountain;
and so the boy, who was about her own age, got his mother to fill for them a basket of good things
to eat, and away they started, hand in hand, to explore the mountain-side.</p>
<p>It was farther to Sugar-Loaf Mountain than Twinkle had thought, and by the time they reached
the foot of the great mound, the rocky sides of which were covered with bushes and small trees,
they were both rather tired by the walk.</p>
<p>"Let's eat something," suggested Chubbins.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/327.jpg" alt="Twinkle and Chubbins"><br>TWINKLE AND
CHUBBINS</p>
<p>"I'm willing," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>So they climbed up a little way, to where some big rocks lay flat upon the mountain, and sat
themselves down upon a slab of rock while they rested and ate some of the sandwiches and
cake.</p>
<p>"Why do they call it 'Sugar-Loaf'?" asked the girl, looking far up to the top of the
mountain.</p>
<p>"I don't know," replied Chubbins.</p>
<p>"It's a queer name," said Twinkle, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"That's so," agreed the boy. "They might as well have called it 'gingerbread' or 'rock-salt,' or
'tea-biscuit.' They call mountains funny names, don't they?"</p>
<p>"Seems as if they do," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>They had been sitting upon the edge of one big flat rock, with their feet resting against another
that was almost as large. These rocks appeared to have been there for ages,&mdash;as if some big
giants in olden days had tossed them carelessly down and then gone away and left them. Yet as the
children pushed their feet against this one, the heavy mass suddenly began to tremble and then slide
downward.</p>
<p>"Look out!" cried the girl, frightened to see the slab of rock move. "We'll fall and get hurt!"</p>
<p>But they clung to the rock upon which they sat and met with no harm whatever. Nor did the big
slab of stone below them move very far from its original position.</p>
<p>It merely slid downward a few feet, and when they looked at the place where it had been they
discovered what seemed to be a small iron door, built into the solid stone underneath, and now
shown to their view by the moving of the upper rock.</p>
<p>"Why, it's a door!" exclaimed Twinkle.</p>
<p>Chubbins got down upon his knees and examined the door carefully. There was a ring in it that
seemed to be a handle, and he caught hold of it and pulled as hard as he could. But it wouldn't
move.</p>
<p>"It's locked, Twink," he said.</p>
<p>"What do you'spose is under it?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's a treasure!" answered Chubbins, his eyes big with interest.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/331.jpg" alt="&quot;May be it's a treasure&quot;"><br>"MAY
BE IT'S A TREASURE"</p>
<p>"Well, Chub, we can't get it, anyway," said the practical Twinkle; "so let's climb the
mountain."</p>
<p>She got down from her seat and approached the door, and as she did so she struck a small bit of
rock with her foot and sent it tumbling down the hill. Then she stopped short with a cry of wonder,
for under the stone she had kicked away was a little hole in the rock, and within this they saw a
small golden key.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," she said, eagerly, as she stooped to pick up the key, "this will unlock the iron
door."</p>
<p>"Let's try it!" cried the boy.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/332.jpg" alt="A key"></p>



<br><br><br>

<hr width="10%">
<h2>Through the Tunnel</h2>
<p><font size="+4">T</font><font size="+2">HEY</font> examined the door carefully, and at last
found near the center of it a small hole. Twinkle put the golden key into this and found that it fitted
exactly. But it took all of Chubbins's strength to turn the key in the rusty lock. Yet finally it did
turn, and they heard the noise of bolts shooting back, so they both took hold of the ring, and
pulling hard together, managed to raise the iron door on its hinges.</p>
<p>All they saw was a dark tunnel, with stone steps leading down into the mountain.</p>
<p>"No treasure here," said the little girl.</p>
<p>"P'raps it's farther in," replied Chub-bins. "Shall we go down?"</p>
<p>"Won't it be dangerous?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Don't know," said Chubbins, honestly. "It's been years and years since this door was opened.
You can see for yourself. That rock must have covered it up a long time."</p>
<p>"There must be <i>something</i> inside," she declared, "or there wouldn't be any door, or any
steps."</p>
<p>"That's so," answered Chubbins. "I'll go down and see. You wait."</p>
<p>"No; I'll go too," said Twinkle. "I'd be just as scared waiting outside as I would be in. And I 'in
bigger than you are, Chub."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/335.jpg" alt="They enter the tunnel"><br>THEY ENTER THE
TUNNEL</p>
<p>"You're taller, but you're only a month older, Twink; so don't you put on airs. And I'm the
strongest."</p>
<p>"We'll both go," she decided; "and then if we find the treasure we'll divide."</p>
<p>"All right; come on!"</p>
<p>Forgetting their basket, which they left upon the rocks, they crept through the little doorway and
down the steps. There were only seven steps in all, and then came a narrow but level tunnel that led
straight into the mountain-side. It was dark a few feet from the door, but the children resolved to go
on. Taking hold of hands, so as not to get separated, and feeling the sides of the passage to guide
them, they walked a long way into the black tunnel.</p>
<p>Twinkle was just about to say they'd better go back, when the passage suddenly turned, and far
ahead of them shone a faint light. This encouraged them, and they went on faster, hoping they
would soon come to the treasure.</p>
<p>"Keep it up, Twink," said the boy. "It's no use going home yet."</p>
<p>"We must be almost in the middle of Sugar-Loaf Mountain," she answered.</p>
<p>"Oh, no; it's an awful big mountain," said he. "But we've come quite a way, haven't we?"</p>
<p>"I guess mama'd scold, if she knew where we are."</p>
<p>"Mamas," said Chubbins, "shouldn't know everything, 'cause they'd only worry. And if we
don't get hurt I can't see as there's any harm done."</p>
<p>"But we mustn't be naughty, Chub."</p>
<p>"The only thing that's naughty," he replied, "is doing what you're told not to do. And no one
told us not to go into the middle of Sugar-Loaf Mountain."</p>
<p>Just then they came to another curve in their path, and saw a bright light ahead. It looked to the
children just like daylight; so they ran along and soon passed through a low arch and came out
into&mdash;</p>
<p>Well! the scene before them was so strange that it nearly took away their breath, and they stood
perfectly still and stared as hard as their big eyes could possibly stare.</p>

<hr width="10%">
<h2>Sugar-Loaf City</h2>
<p><font size="+4">S</font><font size="+2">UGAR-LOAF</font> Mountain was hollow inside,
for the children stood facing a great dome that rose so far above their heads that it seemed almost
as high as the sky. And underneath this dome lay spread out the loveliest city imaginable. There
were streets of houses, and buildings with round domes, and slender, delicate spires reaching far up
into the air, and turrets beautifully ornamented with carvings. And all these were white as the driven
snow and sparkling in every part like millions of diamonds&mdash;for all were built of pure loaf-
sugar! The pavements of the streets were also loaf-sugar, and the trees and bushes and flowers were
likewise sugar; but these last were not all white, because all sugar is not white, and they showed
many bright colors of red sugar and blue sugar and yellow, purple and green sugar, all contrasting
most prettily with the sparkling white buildings and the great white dome overhead.</p>
<p>This alone might well astonish the eyes of children from the outside world, but it was by no
means all that Twinkle and Chubbins beheld in that first curious look at Sugar-Loaf City. For the
city was inhabited by many people&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;who walked along
the streets just as briskly as we do; only all were made of sugar. There were several different kinds
of these sugar people. Some, who strutted proudly along, were evidently of pure loaf-sugar, and
these were of a most respectable appearance. Others seemed to be made of a light brown sugar, and
were more humble in their manners and seemed to hurry along as if they had business to attend to.
Then there were some of sugar so dark in color that Twinkle suspected it was maple-sugar, and
these folks seemed of less account than any of the others, being servants, drivers of carriages, and
beggars and idlers.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/343.jpg" alt="&quot;Surrender!&quot; said the
Captain"><br>"SURRENDER!" SAID THE CAPTAIN</p>
<p>Carts and carriages moved along the streets, and were mostly made of brown sugar. The horses
that drew them were either pressed sugar or maple-sugar. In fact, everything that existed in this
wonderful city was made of some kind of sugar.</p>
<p>Where the light, which made all this place so bright and beautiful, came from, Twinkle could
not imagine. There was no sun, nor were there any electric lights that could be seen; but it was fully
as bright as day and everything showed with great plainness.</p>
<p>While the children, who stood just inside the archway through which they had entered, were
looking at the wonders of Sugar-Loaf City, a file of sugar soldiers suddenly came around a corner
at a swift trot.</p>
<p>"Halt!" cried the Captain. He wore a red sugar jacket and a red sugar cap, and the soldiers were
dressed in the same manner as their Captain, but without the officer's yellow sugar shoulder-straps.
At the command, the sugar soldiers came to a stop, and all pointed their sugar muskets at Twinkle
and Chubbins.</p>
<p>"Surrender!" said the Captain to them. "Surrender, or I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;"</p>
<p>He hesitated.</p>
<p>"What will you do?" said Twinkle.</p>
<p>"I don't know what, but something very dreadful," replied the Captain. "But of course you'll
surrender."</p>
<p>"I suppose we'll have to," answered the girl.</p>
<p>"That's right. I'll just take you to the king, and let him decide what to do," he added
pleasantly.</p>
<p>So the soldiers surrounded the two children, shouldered arms, and marched away down the
street, Twinkle and Chubbins walking slowly, so the candy folks would not have to run; for the
tallest soldiers were only as high as their shoulders.</p>
<p>"This is a great event," remarked the Captain, as he walked beside them with as much dignity as
he could muster. "It was really good of you to come and be arrested, for I haven't had any
excitement in a long time. The people here are such good sugar that they seldom do anything
wrong."</p>

<hr width="10%">
<h2>To the King's Palace</h2>
<p><font size="+4">"W</font><font size="+2">HAT,</font> allow me to ask, is your grade of
sugar?" inquired the Captain, with much politeness. "You do not seem to be the best loaf, but I
suppose that of course you are solid."</p>
<p>"Solid what?" asked Chubbins.</p>
<p>"Solid sugar," replied the Captain.</p>
<p>"We're not sugar at all," explained Twinkle. "We're just meat."</p>
<p>"Meat! And what is that?"</p>
<p>"Haven't you any meat in your city?"</p>
<p>"No," he replied, shaking his head. "Well, I can't explain exactly what meat is," she said; "but it
isn't sugar, anyway."</p>
<p>At this the Captain looked solemn.</p>
<p>"It isn't any of my business, after all," he told them. "The king must decide about you, for that's
<i>his</i> business. But since you are not made of sugar you must excuse me if I decline to
converse with you any longer. It is beneath my dignity."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Where we came from," said Chubbins, "meat costs more a pound than sugar does; so I guess
we're just as good as you are."</p>
<p>But the Captain made no reply to this statement, and before long they stopped in front of a big
sugar building, while a crowd of sugar people quickly gathered.</p>
<p>"Stand back!" cried the Captain, and the sugar soldiers formed a row between the children and
the sugar citizens, and kept the crowd from getting too near. Then the Captain led Twinkle and
Chubbins through a high sugar gateway and up a broad sugar walk to the entrance of the
building.</p>
<p>"Must be the king's castle," said Chubbins.</p>
<p>"The king's palace," corrected the Captain, stiffly.</p>
<p>"What's the difference?" asked Twinkle.</p>
<p>But the sugar officer did not care to explain.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/351.jpg" alt="The king's palace"><br>THE KING'S
PALACE</p>
<p>Brown sugar servants in plum-colored sugar coats stood at the entrance to the palace, and their
eyes stuck out like lozenges from their sugar faces when they saw the strangers the Captain was
escorting.</p>
<p>But every one bowed low, and stood aside for them to pass, and they walked through beautiful
halls and reception rooms where the sugar was cut into panels and scrolls and carved to represent
all kinds of fruit and flowers.</p>
<p>"Isn't it sweet!" said Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Sure it is," answered Chubbins.</p>
<p>And now they were ushered into a magnificent room, where a stout little sugar man was sitting
near the window playing upon a fiddle, while a group of sugar men and women stood before him
in respectful attitudes and listened to the music.</p>
<p>Twinkle knew at once that the fiddler was the king, because he had a sugar crown upon his
head. His Majesty was made of very white and sparkling cut loaf-sugar, and his clothing was
formed of the same pure material. The only color about him was the pink sugar in his cheeks and
the brown sugar in his eyes. His fiddle was also of white sugar, and the strings were of spun sugar
and had an excellent tone.</p>
<p>When the king saw the strange children enter the room he jumped up and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Bless my beets! What have we here?"</p>
<p>"Mortals, Most Granular and Solidified Majesty," answered the Captain, bowing so low that his
forehead touched the floor. "They came in by the ancient tunnel."</p>
<p>"Well, I declare," said the king. "I thought that tunnel had been stopped up for good and
all."</p>
<p>"The stone above the door slipped," said Twinkle, "so we came down to see what we could
find."</p>
<p>"You must never do it again," said his Majesty, sternly. "This is our own kingdom, a peaceful
and retired nation of extra refined and substantial citizens, and we don't wish to mix with mortals,
or any other folks."</p>
<p>"We'll go back, pretty soon," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Now, that's very nice of you," declared the king, "and I appreciate your kindness. Are you
extra refined, my dear?"</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/355.jpg" alt="His Majesty the King"><br>HIS MAJESTY THE
KING</p>
<p>"I hope so," said the girl, a little doubtfully.</p>
<p>"Then there's no harm in our being friendly while you're here. And as you've promised to go
back to your own world soon, I have no objection to showing you around the town. You'd like to
see how we live, wouldn't you?"</p>
<p>"Very much," said Twinkle.</p>
<p>"Order my chariot, Captain Brittle," said his Majesty; and the Captain again made one of his
lowly bows and strutted from the room to execute the command.</p>
<p>The king now introduced Chubbins and Twinkle to the sugar ladies and gentlemen who were
present, and all of them treated the children very respectfully.</p>


<br><br><br>
<h1><a name="6-5">Chapter V</a></h1>
<hr width="10%">
<h2>Princess Sakareen</h2>
<p><font size="+4">"S</font><font size="+2">AY,</font> play us a tune," said Chubbins to the
king. His Majesty didn't seem to like being addressed so bluntly, but he was very fond of playing
the fiddle, so he graciously obeyed the request and played a pretty and pathetic ballad upon the
spun sugar strings. Then, begging to be excused for a few minutes while the chariot was being made
ready, the king left them and went into another room.</p>
<p>This gave the children a chance to talk freely with the sugar people, and Chubbins said to one
man, who looked very smooth on the outside:</p>
<p>"I s'pose you're one of the big men of this place, aren't you?"</p>
<p>The man looked frightened for a moment, and then took the boy's arm and led him into a
corner of the room.</p>
<p>"You ask me an embarrassing question," he whispered, looking around to make sure that no
one overheard. "Although I pose as one of the nobility, I am, as a matter of fact, a great fraud!"</p>
<p>"How's that?" asked Chubbins.</p>
<p>"Have you noticed how smooth I am?" inquired the sugar man.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the boy. "Why is it?"</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/359.jpg" alt="&quot;I pose as one of the
nobility&quot;"><br>"I POSE AS ONE OF THE NOBILITY"</p>
<p>"Why, I'm frosted, that's the reason. No one here suspects it, and I'm considered very
respectable; but the truth is, I'm just coated over with frosting, and not solid sugar at all."</p>
<p>"What's inside you?" asked Chubbins.</p>
<p>"That," answered the man, "I do not know. I've never dared to find out. For if I broke my
frosting to see what I'm stuffed with, every one else would see too, and I would be disgraced and
ruined."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you're cake," suggested the boy.</p>
<p>"Perhaps so," answered the man, sadly. "Please keep my secret, for only those who are solid
loaf-sugar are of any account in this country, and at present I am received in the best society, as
you see."</p>
<p>"Oh, I won't tell," said Chubbins.</p>
<p>During this time Twinkle had been talking with a sugar lady, in another part of the room. This
lady seemed to be of the purest loaf-sugar, for she sparkled most beautifully, and Twinkle thought
she was quite the prettiest person to look at that she had yet seen.</p>
<p>"Are you related to the king?" she asked.</p>
<p>"No, indeed," answered the sugar lady, "although I'm considered one of the very highest
quality. But I'll tell you a secret, my dear." She took Twinkle's hand and led her across to a sugar
sofa, where they both sat down.</p>
<p>"No one," resumed the sugar lady, "has ever suspected the truth; but I'm only a sham, and it
worries me dreadfully."</p>
<p>"I don't understand what you mean," said Twinkle. "Your sugar seems as pure and sparkling as
that of the king."</p>
<p>"Things are not always what they seem," sighed the sugar lady. "What you see of me, on the
outside, is all right; but the fact is, <i>I'm hollow!</i>"</p>
<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Twinkle, in surprise. "How do you know it?"</p>
<p>"I can feel it," answered the lady, impressively. "If you weighed me you'd find I'm not as heavy
as the solid ones, and for a long time I've realized the bitter truth that I'm hollow. It makes me very
unhappy, but I don't dare confide my secret to any one here, because it would disgrace me
forever."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/363.jpg" alt="&quot;I'm hollow!&quot;"><br>"I'M
HOLLOW!"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't worry," said the child. "They'll never know the difference."</p>
<p>"Not unless I should break," replied the sugar lady. "But if that happened, all the world could
see that I'm hollow, and instead of being welcomed in good society I'd become an outcast. It's even
more respectable to be made of brown sugar, than to be hollow; don't you think so?"</p>
<p>"I'm a stranger here," said Twinkle; "so I can't judge. But if I were you, I wouldn't worry unless
I got broke; and you may be wrong, after all, and as sound as a brick!"</p>

<hr width="10%">
<h2>The Royal Chariot</h2>
<p><font size="+4">J</font><font size="+2">UST</font> then the king came back to the room and
said:</p>
<p>"The chariot is at the door; and, as there are three seats, I'll take Lord Cloy and Princess
Sakareen with us."</p>
<p>So the children followed the king to the door of the palace, where stood a beautiful white and
yellow sugar chariot, drawn by six handsome sugar horses with spun sugar tails and manes, and
driven by a brown sugar coachman in a blue sugar livery.</p>
<p>The king got in first, and the others followed. Then the children discovered that Lord Cloy was
the frosted man and Princess Sakareen was the sugar lady who had told Twinkle that she was
hollow.</p>
<p>There was quite a crowd of sugar people at the gates to watch the departure of the royal party,
and a few soldiers and policemen were also present to keep order. Twinkle sat beside the king, and
Chubbins sat on the same seat with the Princess Sakareen, while Lord Cloy was obliged to sit with
the coachman. When all were ready the driver cracked a sugar whip (but didn't break it), and away
the chariot dashed over a road paved with blocks of cut loaf-sugar.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/367.jpg" alt="The chariot dashed away"><br>THE CHARIOT
DASHED AWAY</p>
<p>The air was cool and pleasant, but there was a sweet smell to the breeze that was peculiar to this
strange country. Sugar birds flew here and there, singing sweet songs, and a few sugar dogs ran out
to bark at the king's chariot as it whirled along.</p>
<p>"Haven't you any automobiles in your country?" asked the girl.</p>
<p>"No," answered the king. "Anything that requires heat to make it go is avoided here, because
heat would melt us and ruin our bodies in a few minutes. Automobiles would be dangerous in
Sugar-Loaf City."</p>
<p>"They're dangerous enough anywhere," she said. "What do you feed to your horses?"</p>
<p>"They eat a fine quality of barley-sugar that grows in our fields," answered the king. "You'll see
it presently, for we will drive out to my country villa, which is near the edge of the dome, opposite
to where you came in."</p>
<p>First, however, they rode all about the city, and the king pointed out the public buildings, and
the theaters, and the churches, and a number of small but pretty public parks. And there was a high
tower near the center that rose half-way to the dome, it was so tall.</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid the roof will cave in some time, and ruin your city?" Twinkle asked the
king.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," he answered. "We never think of such a thing. Isn't there a dome over the place
where you live?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Twinkle; "but it's the sky."</p>
<p>"Do you ever fear it will cave in?" inquired the king.</p>
<p>"No, indeed!" she replied, with a laugh at the idea.</p>
<p>"Well, it's the same way with us," returned his Majesty. "Domes are the strongest things in all
the world."</p>

<h2>Twinkle Gets Thirsty</h2>
<p><font size="+4">A</font><font size="+2">FTER</font> they had seen the sights of the city the
carriage turned into a broad highway that led into the country, and soon they began to pass fields of
sugar corn and gardens of sugar cabbages and sugar beets and sugar potatoes. There were also
orchards of sugar plums and sugar apples and vineyards of sugar grapes. All the trees were sugar,
and even the grass was sugar, while sugar grasshoppers hopped about in it. Indeed, Chubbins
decided that not a speck of anything beneath the dome of Sugar-Loaf Mountain was anything but
pure sugar&mdash;unless the inside of the frosted man proved to be of a different material.</p>
<p>By and by they reached a pretty villa, where they all left the carriage and followed the sugar
king into the sugar house. Refreshments had been ordered in advance, over the sugar telephone, so
that the dining table was already laid and all they had to do was to sit in the pretty sugar chairs and
be waited upon by maple-sugar attendants.</p>
<p>There were sandwiches and salads and fruits and many other sugar things to eat, served on
sugar plates; and the children found that some were flavored with winter-green and raspberry and
lemon, so that they were almost as good as candies. At each plate was a glass made of crystal sugar
and filled with thick sugar syrup, and this seemed to be the only thing to drink. After eating so
much sugar the children naturally became thirsty, and when the king asked Twinkle if she would
like anything else she answered promptly:</p>
<p>"Yes, I'd like a drink of water."</p>
<p>At once a murmur of horror arose from the sugar people present, and the king pushed back his
chair as if greatly disturbed.</p>
<p>"Water!" he exclaimed, in amazement.</p>
<p>"Sure," replied Chubbins. "I want some, too. We're thirsty."</p>
<p>The king shuddered.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/375.jpg" alt="&quot;Water!&quot; he
exclaimed"><br>"WATER!" HE EXCLAIMED</p>
<p>"Nothing in the world," said he gravely, "is so dangerous as water. It melts sugar in no time, and
to drink it would destroy you instantly."</p>
<p>"We're not made of sugar," said Twinkle. "In our country we drink all the water we want."</p>
<p>"It may be true," returned the king; "but I am thankful to say there is no drop of water in all this
favored country. But we have syrup, which is much better for your health. It fills up the spaces
inside you, and hardens and makes you solid."</p>
<p>"It makes me thirstier than ever," said the girl. "But if you have no water we must try to get
along until we get home again."</p>
<p>When the luncheon was over, they entered the carriage again and were driven back towards the
city. On the way the six sugar horses became restless, and pranced around in so lively a manner
that the sugar coachman could scarcely hold them in. And when they had nearly reached the palace
a part of the harness broke, and without warning all six horses dashed madly away. The chariot
smashed against a high wall of sugar and broke into many pieces, the sugar people, as well as
Twinkle and Chubbins, being thrown out and scattered in all directions.</p>
<p>The little girl was not at all hurt, nor was Chubbins, who landed on top the wall and had to
climb down again. But the king had broken one of the points off his crown, and sat upon the
ground gazing sorrowfully at his wrecked chariot. And Lord Cloy, the frosted man, had smashed
one of his feet, and everybody could now see that underneath the frosting was a material very like
marshmallow&mdash;a discovery that was sure to condemn him as unfit for the society of the solid
sugar-loaf aristocracy of the country.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most serious accident of all had befallen Princess Sakareen, whose left leg had
broken short off at the knee. Twinkle ran up to her as soon as she could, and found the Princess
smiling happily and gazing at the part of the broken leg which she had picked up.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/379.jpg" alt="The Princess' leg had broken"><br>THE
PRINCESS' LEG HAD BROKEN</p>
<p>"See here, Twinkle," she cried; "it's as solid as the king himself! I'm not hollow at all. It was
only my imagination."</p>
<p>"I'm glad of that," answered Twinkle; "but what will you do with a broken leg?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's easily mended," said the Princess, "All I must do is to put a little syrup on the broken
parts, and stick them together, and then sit in the breeze until it hardens. I'll be all right in an hour
from now."</p>
<p>It pleased Twinkle to hear this, for she liked the pretty sugar princess.</p>

<h2>After the Runaway</h2>
<p><font size="+4">N</font><font size="+2">OW</font> the king came up to them, saying: "I
hope you are not injured."</p>
<p>"We are all right," said Twinkle; "but I'm getting dreadful thirsty, so if your Majesty has no
objection I guess we'll go home."</p>
<p>"No objection at all," answered the king.</p>
<p>Chubbins had been calmly filling his pockets with broken spokes and other bits of the wrecked
chariot; but feeling nearly as thirsty as Twinkle, he was glad to learn they were about to start for
home.</p>
<p>They exchanged good-byes with all their sugar friends, and thanked the sugar king for his royal
entertainment. Then Captain Brittle and his soldiers escorted the children to the archway through
which they had entered Sugar-Loaf City.</p>
<p>They had little trouble in going back, although the tunnel was so dark in places that they had to
feel their way. But finally daylight could be seen ahead, and a few minutes later they scrambled up
the stone steps and squeezed through the little doorway.</p>
<p>There was their basket, just as they had left it, and the afternoon sun was shining softly over the
familiar worldly landscape, which they were both rejoiced to see again.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/383.jpg" alt="&quot;Where's the key?&quot; asked
Twinkle"><br>"WHERE'S THE KEY?" ASKED TWINKLE</p>
<p>Chubbins closed the iron door, and as soon as he did so the bolts shot into place, locking it
securely.</p>
<p>"Where's the key?" asked Twinkle.</p>
<p>"I put it into my pocket," said Chubbins, "but it must have dropped out when I tumbled from
the king's chariot."</p>
<p>"That's too bad," said Twinkle; "for now no one can ever get to the sugar city again. The door is
locked, and the key is on the other side."</p>
<p>"Never mind," said the boy. "We've seen the inside of Sugar-Loaf Mountain once, and that'll do
us all our lives. Come on, Twink. Let's go home and get a drink!"</p>
